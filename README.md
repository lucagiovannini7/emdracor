# EmDraCor (Early Modern Drama Corpus)

Files and scripts related to my PhD project developed between 2021 and 2024 at the Universities of Potsdam and Padova and defended in March 2025. See the related dissertation: _[Evolutive Dynamics in Early Modern European Drama: A Computational Approach](https://doi.org/10.25932/publishup-69516)_ (PDF)

This repository contains the following folders:
* `tei`: 150 early modern European plays, encoded in XML-TEI. This folder, together with the `corpus.xml` file, allows to (re)build the corpus on a Dockerised version of DraCor through [StableDraCor](https://github.com/dracor-org/stabledracor)
* `scripts`: Python code for corpus building and analysis
* `metadata`: tables and other useful files
