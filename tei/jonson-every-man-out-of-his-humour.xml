          <p>A Vaine-glorious Knight, ouer-Englishing his trauels, and wholly consecrated to Singularitie; the very Iacobs staffe of Complement: a Sir that hath liu'd to see the revolution of Time in most of his apparell. Of presence good ynough, but so palpably affected to his owne praise, that (for want of flatterers) he commends himself to the floutage of his own Familie. He deales vpon returns, and strange performances, resoluing (in despight of publicke derision) to sticke to his own particular fashion, phrase, and gesture. </p>

A <pb xml:id="ep000108-003-a"/>good Feast-hound or Banket-beagell, that will sent you out a supper some three mile off, and sweare to his Patrons (God dam me) he came in Oars when he was but wasted ouer in a Sculler. A slaue that hath an extraordinarie gift in pleasing his Pallat, and will swill vp more Sacke at a sitting, than would make all the Guard a Posset. His Religion is railing, and his discourse Ribaldrie. They stand highest in his respect, whom he studies most to reproch. </p>

Hee will borrow another mans Horse to praise, and backs him as his own. Or for a need on foot can post himselfe into credite with his Merchant, only with the Gingle of his spurre, and the Ierke of his Wand. </p>

          <p>A Good doting Citizen, who (it is thought) might be of the Common Counsell for his wealth: a fellow sincerely besotted on his owne wife, and so rapt with a conceit of her perfections, that hee simply holds himselfe vnworthie of her. And in that hood-winkt Humour, liues more like a Suter than a husband; standing in as true dread of her displeasure, as when hee first made loue to her. He doth sacrifice twopence in Iuniper to her euery morning before sherises, &amp; wakes her with villanous-out-of-tune Musick, which shee out of her Contempt (though not out of her iudgement) is sure to dislike. </p>

        <p>2 It is to be conceiu'd, that Macilente being so strongly possest with Enuie, (as the Poet heere makes him) it must bee no sleight or common Object, that should effect so suddaine and straunge a cure vpon him, as the putting him cleane Out of his Humor. </p>

        <p>4 His greedinesse to catch at any Occasion, that might expresse his affection to his Soueraigne, may worthily plead for him. </p>
        <p>5 There was nothing (in his examin'd Opinion) that could more neare or truly exemplifie the power and strength of her Inualuable Vertues, than the working of so perfect a Miracle on so oppos'd a Spirit, who not only persisted in his Humor, but was now come to the Court with a purpos'd resolution (his Soule as it were new drest in Enuie) to maligne at any thing that should front him; when sodainly (against expectation, <pb xml:id="ep000108-067-a"/>and all steele of his Malice) the verie wonder of her Presence strikes him to the earth dumbe, and astonisht.

Wel, Gentlemen, I should haue gone in, and return'd to you as I was Asper at the first: but (by reason the Shift would haue been somewhat long, and we are loth to draw your Patience any farder) wee'le intreat you to imagine it. And now (that you may see I will be out of Humor for companie) I stand wholly to your kind Approbation, and (indeed) am nothing so peremptorie as I was in the beginning: Mary I will not doe as Plautus in his Amphitryo for all this (Summi Iouis causa, Plaudite:) begge a Plaudite for Gods sake; but if you (out of the Bountie of your good liking) will bestow it; why, you may (in time) make leane Macilente as fat as Sir Iohn Fallstaffe. </p>
