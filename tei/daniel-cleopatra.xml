        <head>THE ARGVMENT. </head>
        <p>AFter the death of Antonius, Cleopatra (liuing still in the Monument shee had caused to be built,) could not by any means be drawne forth, although Octauius Caesar verie earnestly laboured it: &amp; sent Proculeius to vse all diligence to bring her vnto him: For that hee though it woulde be a great ornament to his Tryumphes, to get her aliue to Rome. But neuer woulde shee put herselfe into the hands of Proculeius, although on a time he found the meanes, (by a window that was at the top of the Monument,) to come downe vnto her: where hee perswaded her (all hee might) to <pb xml:id="ep000360-059-a"/>yeeld herselfe to Caesars mercie. Which shee, (to be ridd of him,) cunningly seemed to grant vnto. After that, Octauius in person went to visite her, to whom shee excus'd her offence, laying all the fault vpon the greatnes, and feare shee had of Antonius, and withall, seemed verie tractable, and willing to be disposed of by him. </p>
        <p>Where-vpon, Octauius (thinking himselfe sure) resolu'd presently to send her away to Rome. Whereof, Dolabella a fauorite of Caesars, (and one that was grown into some good liking of her,) hauing certified her, shee makes her humble peticion to Caesar, that he would suffer her to sacrifize to the ghost of Antonius: which being granted her, shee was brought vnto his Sepulcher, where after her rites performed, shee returned to the Monument, and there dined, with great magnificence. And in dinner time, came there one in the habite of a Countriman, with a basket of figgs vnto her, who (vnsuspected) was suffered to carry them in. And in that basket (among the figges) were conuaid the Aspicks wherewith shee did herselfe to death. Dinner beeing <pb xml:id="ep000360-059-b"/>ended, shee dispatched Letters to Caesar, contayning great lamentations: with an earnest supplication, that shee might be entomb'd with Antonius. Wherevpon, Caesar knowing what shee intended, sent presently with all speed, messengers to haue preuented her death, which notwithstanding, before they came was dispatched. </p>
        <p>Cesario her sonne, which shee had by Iulius Caesar, (conuaied before vnto India, out of the danger of the warrs,) was about the same time of her death, murthered at Rhodes: trained thether by the falshood of his Tutor, corrupted by Caesar. And so heereby, came the race of the Ptolomies to be wholy extinct, &amp; the florishing ritch Kingdome of Egipt vtterly ouer-throwne and subdued. </p>

          <l>And that I saw my state, and knew my beauty, </l>
          <l>Saw how the world admir'd mee, how they woode, </l>

          <l>That men loue for them-selues, and not for vs. </l>
          <l>Then, and but thus, thou didst loue most sincerely, </l>
          <l>(O Anthony,) that best deseru'dst it better </l>

            <l>Well did our Priests discerne something diuine </l>

            <l>Marching with Life, and Shame that still incroches </l>

            <l>Shee presently proceeds to th'execution. </l>
            <l>And sharply blaming of her rebell powres, </l>
            <l>False flesh, (sayth shee,) and what dost thou conspire </l>

            <l>For to the minde that's great, nothing seemes great. </l>

            <l>What doe I lose, that haue but life to lose? </l>
            <l>This hauing said, strengthned in her owne hart, </l>

            <l>That hath so great a part of glory wonne. </l>
            <l>And so receiues the deadly poysning touch. </l>

            <l>But still in one same sweete vnaltred cheere, </l>
            <l>Her honor did her dying thoughts retaine. </l>
            <l>Well, now this work is done (saith she,) here ends </l>
            <l>This act of life, that part of Fates assign'd mee: </l>
            <l>What glory or disgrace heere this world lends, </l>
            <l>Both haue I had, and both I leaue behinde mee. </l>
            <l>And now ô Earth, the Theater where I </l>

            <l>For in that instant I might well perceiue, </l>
            <l>The drowsie humor in her falling brow: </l>
            <l>And how each powre, each part opprest did leaue </l>

            <l>Couller so liuely, cheere so louely rife, </l>
            <l>That none wold think such beauty could want breath. </l>
            <l>And in that cheere, th'impression of a smile </l>
            <l>Did seeme to shew shee scorned Death and Caesar, </l>
            <l>As glorying that shee could them both beguile, </l>
            <l>And telling death how much her death did please her. </l>
            <l>Wonder it was to see how soone shee went, </l>
            <l>Shee went with such a will, and did so haste it, </l>
            <l>That sure I thinke shee did her paine preuent, </l>
            <l>Fore-going paine, or staying not to taste it. </l>
            <l>And sencelesse, in her sinking downe shee wryes </l>

            <l>Which Charmion (poore weake feeble mayd) espyes, </l>
            <l>And hastes to right it as it was before. </l>
            <l>For Eras now was dead, and Charmion too </l>
            <l>Euen at the poynt, for both would imitate </l>
            <l>Theyr Mistres glory, striuing like to doo. </l>
            <l>But Charmion would in this exceede her mate, </l>

            <l>That should adorne that head that must be seene </l>
            <l>To weare a Crowne in death, that life held fast, </l>
            <l>That all the world might know shee dyde a Queene. </l>
            <pb xml:id="ep000360-097-b"/>
            <l>And as shee stood setting if fitly on, </l>
            <l>Lo in rush Caesars Messengers in haste, </l>
            <l>Thinking to haue preuented what was doone, </l>
            <l>But yet they came too late, for all was past. </l>
            <l>For there they found stretch'd on a bed of gold, </l>
            <l>Dead Cleopatra, and that proudly dead, </l>
            <l>In all the riche attyre procure shee could, </l>
            <l>And dying Charmion trymming of her head. </l>
            <l>And Eras at her feete, dead in like case. </l>
            <l>Charmion, is this well doone? said one of them. </l>
            <l>Yea, well sayd shee, and her that from the race </l>
            <l>Of so great Kings discends, doth best become. </l>
            <l>And with that word, yeelds too her faithful breath, </l>
            <l>To passe th'assurance of her loue with death. </l>
