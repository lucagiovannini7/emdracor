        <head>To the most Illustrious Prince WILLIAM, DUKE, MARQUIS, and EARL OF NEWCASTLE, &amp;c. </head>
        <opener>May it please your Grace, </opener>
        <p>THe Favours have been so many and so great, which your Grace's unwearied Bounty has conferred upon me, that I cannot omit this oportunity of telling the World, how much I have been obliged, and by whom. My Gratitude will not suffer me to smother the favoÃÑurs in silence; nor the Pride they have rais'd me to, let me conceal, the Name of so Excellent a Patron. The honour of being favoured by the great Newcastle, is equal with any real Merit, I am sure infinitely above mine. Yet the encouragement I receive from your Grace, is the certain way to make <pb xml:id="ep000731-003-a"/>the World believe I have some desert, or to create in me the most favourable thoughts of my self. My Name may thus, when otherwise it would perish, live in after Ages, under the protection of your Grace's, which, is famous abroad, and will be Eterniz'd in this Nation, for your Wit beyond all Poets; Judgment and Prudence, before all Statesmen; Courage and Conduct, above all Generals; Constancy and Loyalty, beyond all Subjects; Virtue and Temperance, above all Philosophers; for skill in Weapons, and Horsemanship, and all other Arts befitting your Quality, excelling all Noblemen: And lastly, for those eminent Services in defence of your King and Countrey, with an Interest and Power much exceeding all, and with Loyalty equalling any Nobleman. And indeed, the first was so great, that it might justly have made the greatest Prince afraid of it, had it not been so strongly secured by the latter. </p>
        <p>All these Heroick Qualities I admired, and worshipped at a distance, before I had the Honour to wait upon your Grace at your House. For so vast was your Bounty to me, as to find me out in my obscurity, and oblige me several years, before you saw me at Welbeck; where (when I arrived) I found a Respect so extremely above the meanness of my Condition, that I still received it with blushes; having had nothing to recommend me, (but the Birth and Education, without the Fortune of a Gentleman) besides some Writings of mine, which your Grace was pleased to like. Then was soon added to my former Worship and Admiration, <pb xml:id="ep000731-003-b"/>„Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ, and infinite Gratitude, and a Pride of being „Äà‚óä„Äâ by one, in whom I observ'd a Majesty equal with greatest Princes, yet Affability exceeding ordinary Gentlemen. A Greatness, that none e'r approached without Awe, or parted from without Satisfaction. </p>
        <p>Then (by the great honour I had to be daily admitted into your, Grace's publick and private Conversation) I observed that admirable Experience and Judgment surmounting all the Old, and that vigorousness of Wit, and Smartness of Expression, exceeding all the Young, I ever knew; and not onely in sharp and apt Replies, the most excellent way of pursuing a Discourse; but (which is much more difficult) by giving easie and unforced occasions, the most admirable way of begining one; and all this adapted to men of all Circumstances and Conditions. Your Grace being able to discourse with every man in his own way, which, as it shows you to be a most accurate Observer of all mens tempers, so it shows your Excellency in all their Arts. But when I had the favour daily to be admitted to your Grace's more retired Conversation, when I alone enjoyed the honour, I must declare, I never spent my hours with that pleasure, or improvement; nor shall I ever enough acknowledge that, and the rest of the Honours done me by your Grace, as much above my Condition as my Merit. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000731-004-a"/>
        <p>And now, my Lord, after all this, imagine not I intend this small Present of a Play (though favoured here by those I most wish it should be) as any return; for all the Services of my life cannot make a sufficient one. I onely lay hold on this occasion, to publish to the World your great Favours, and the grateful Acknowledgments of, </p>

        <head>PREFACE. </head>
        <p>THe story from which I took the hint of this Play, is famous all over <hi>Spain, Italy</hi>, and France: It was first put into a Spanish Play (as I have been told) the Spaniards having a Tradition (which they believe) of such a vicious Spaniard, as is represented in this Play. From them the Italian Comedians took it, and from them the French took it, and four several French Plays were made upon the Story. </p>
        <p>The Character of the Libertine, and consequently those of his Friends, are borrow'd; but all the Plot, till the latter end of the Fourth Act, is new: And all the rest is very much varied from any thing which has been done upon the Subject. </p>
        <p>I hope the Readers will excuse the Irregularities of the Play, when they consider, that the Extravagance of the Subject forced me to it: And I had rather try new ways to please, than to write on in the same Road, as too many do. I hope that the severest Reader will not be offended at the representation of those Vices, on <pb xml:id="ep000731-005-a"/>

          <pb xml:id="ep000731-005-b"/>
          <gap extent="1" reason="duplicate" unit="pages"/>
          <pb xml:id="ep000731-006-a"/>which they will see a dreadful punishment inflicted. And I have been told by a worthy Gentleman, that many years agon (when first a Play, was made upon this Story in Italy) he has seen it acted there by the name of <hi>Atheisto Fulminato</hi>, in Churches, on Sundays, as a part of Devotion; and some, not of the least Judgment and Piety here, have thought it rather an useful Moral, than an incouragement to vice. </p>
        <p>I have no reason to complain of the success of this Play, since it pleased those, whom, of all the world, I would please most. Nor was the Town unkind to it, for which reason I must applaud my good Fortune, to have pleased with so little pains: there being no Act in it, which cost me above five days writing; and the last two, (the Play-house having great occasion for a Play) were both written in four days, as several can testifie. And this I dare declare, notwithstanding the soul, course, and ill-manner'd censure passed upon them, (who write Plays in three, four, or sive weeks time) by a rough hobling Rhimer, in his Postscript to another Man's Play, which he spoil'd, and call'd, <hi>Love and Revenge</hi>; I having before publickly owned the writing two Plays in so short a time. He ought not to have measured any Man's Abilities, who writes for the Stage with his own; for some may write that in three weeks, which he cannot in three years. But he is angry, that any man should write sense so easily, when he finds it so laborious a thing to write, even Fustian, that he is believed to have been three years drudging upon the <pb xml:id="ep000731-006-b"/>
          <hi>Conquest of China‚ñ™ </hi>But he ought not to be called a Poet, who cannot write ten times a better in three weeks. </p>
        <p>I cannot here pass by his sawcy Epistle to this Conquest, which (instead of expressions of just respect, due to the Birth and Merit of his Patron) is stuffed with railing against others. And first, he begins with the vanity of his Tribe. What Tribe that really is, it is not hard to ghess; but all the Poets will bear me witness it is not theirs, who are sufficiently satisfied, that he is no more a Poet than Servant to his Majesty, as he presumes to write himself; which I wonder he will do, since Protections are taken off: I know not what Place he is Sworn into in Extraordinary, but I am sure there is no such thing as Poet in Extraordinary. </p>
        <p>But I wonder (after all his railing) he will call these Poets his Brethren; if they were, me-thinks he might have more natural affection than to abuse his Brethren: but he might have spared that Title, for we can find no manner of Relation betwixt him and them; for they are all Gentlemen, that will not own him, or keep him company: and that, perhaps, is the cause which makes him so angry with them, to tax them, in his ill-manner'd Epistle, with Impudence, which he (having a particular affection for his own vice) calls by the name of Frailty. Impudence indeed is a very pretty Frailty. </p>
        <p>But (what ever the Poets are guilty of) I wish he had as much of Poetry in him, as he has of that Frailty, for the good of the Duke's Theatre; they might then <pb xml:id="ep000731-007-a"/>have hopes of gaining as much by his good Sense, as as they have lost by his Fustian. </p>
        <p>Thus much I thought sit to say in vindication of the Poets, though, I think, he has not Authority enough (with men of sense) to fix any calumny upon the Tribe, as he calls it. For which reason I shall never trouble my self to take notice of him hereafter, since all men of Wit will think, that he can do the Poets no greater injury, than pretending to be one. Nor had I said so much in answer to his course railing, but to reprehend his Arrogance, and lead him to a little better knowledge of himself; nor does his base Language in his Postscript deserve a better Return. </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>OUr Author sent me hither for a Scout, </l>
          <l>To spy what bloudy Criticks were come out; </l>
          <l>Those Piccaroons in Wit, wh'infest this Road, </l>
          <l>And snap both Friend and Foe that come abroad. </l>
          <l>This savage Party crueller appears, </l>
          <l>Than in the Channel Ostend Privateers. </l>
          <l>You in this Road, or sink or plunder all, </l>
          <l>Remorsless as a Storm on us you fall: </l>
          <l>But as a Merchant, when by storms distress'd, </l>
          <l>Flings out his bulkey Goods to save the rest, </l>
          <l>Hoping a Calm may come, he keeps the best. </l>
          <l>In this black Tempest which o'r us impends, </l>
          <l>Near Rocks and Quick sands, and no Ports of Friends, </l>
          <l>Our Poet gives this over to your rage, </l>
          <l>The most irregular Play upon the Stage, </l>
          <l>As wild and as extravagant as th' Age. </l>
          <l>Now, angry men, to all your splenes give vent; </l>
          <l>When all your fury has on this been spent, </l>
          <l>Else-where you with much worse shall be content. </l>
          <l>The Poet has no hopes you'll be appeas'd, </l>
          <l>Who come on purpose but to be displeas'd. </l>
          <l>Such corrupt Judges should excepted be, </l>
          <l>Who can condemn before they hear or see. </l>
          <l>Ne'r were such bloudy Criticks yet in fashion; </l>
          <l>You damn by absolute Predestination. </l>
          <l>But why so many to run one man down? </l>
          <l>It were a mighty triumph when y'have done. </l>
          <l>Our scarcity of Plays you should not „Äà‚óä„Äâ, </l>
          <l>When by foul „Äà‚óä„Äâ „Äà‚óä„Äâ destroy the Game. </l>
          <l>Let him but have fair play, and he may then </l>
          <l>Write himself into favour once again. </l>
          <l>If after this your anger you'll reveal, </l>
          <l>To Caesar he must make his just appeal; </l>
          <l>There Mercy and Judgment equally do meet, </l>
          <l>To pardon Faults, and to encourage Wit.. </l>
