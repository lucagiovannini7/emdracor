        <p>HAving long since devoted my self to a Country Life, and wanting Patience to attend the leisure of the Stage, I have adventur'd to exposed this Tragedy, without Action; but I shall never be much asham'd of it, since it has had the Honor of your Lordships Approbation, whose admirable Genius in Poetry, has long since given you a just Title to preside over all Causes of that kind, and whose Judgement never Errs, but when 'tis seduc'd by your <hi>Extraordinory Candor</hi>. Yet to have a share in your Lordship's Mercy, rather than all the Clamorous Applauses of the Vulgar, shall ever be esteemed a greater Honor to, </p>

          <head>TO THE AUTHOR. </head>
          <l>WHen o'r the World the mild Augustus Reign'd, </l>
          <l>Wit's Empire too the Roman Poets gain'd: </l>
          <l>So when the first auspicious James possest </l>
          <l>Our Brittish World, and in Possessing blest; </l>
          <l>Our Poets wore the Lawrels of the Age, </l>
          <l>While <hi>Shakespear, Fletcher, Johnson </hi>Crown'd. the Stage </l>
          <l>And tho our Caesars since have rais'd the State, </l>
          <l>Our Poetry sustains the Roman Fate. </l>
          <l>In less Essays successful we have been, </l>
          <l>But lost the Nobler Province of the Scene: </l>
          <l>Perverters, not Reformers of the Stage, </l>
          <l>Deprav'd to Farce, or more fantastick Rage. </l>
          <l>How therefore shall we Celebrate thy Name, </l>
          <l>Whose Genius has so well retriev'd our Fame? </l>
          <l>Whose happy Muse such Wonders can impart, </l>
          <l>And temper Shakespear's Flame with Johnson's Art. </l>
          <l>Whose Characters set just Examples forth; </l>
          <l>Mix Humane Frailties with Heroick Worth: </l>
          <l>Shunning th' Extreams in Modern Heroes seen, </l>
          <l>Than God's more perfect, or more frail than Men. </l>
          <l>With Reason, Nature, Truth our Minds you treat, </l>
          <l>And shew a Prince irregularly Great. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000572-004-a"/>
          <l>A generous Soul storm'd by impetuous Love, </l>
          <l>Which yet from Virtue's Centre scorns to move. </l>
          <l>Thus while the Hero does himself defeat, </l>
          <l>Your Tamerlane is rendred truly GREAT, </l>
          <l>When by his Troops whole Empires were o'rthrown, </l>

          <l>Iago in Ragalzan lives again. </l>
          <l>Not Hecuba like your Despina Rag'd, </l>

          <l>With Iphigene your Fair Irene vies, </l>

          <l>Your Style, tho just, subservient to the Thought; </l>
          <l>Your Numbers in Majestic Plainness wrought. </l>
          <l>Methinks I see the Pyrat-Wits of France </l>
          <l>Already to this Noble Prize Advance: </l>
          <l>An Artifice in which they most excel, </l>
          <l>But still, the Sense they steal, they Husband well▪ </l>
          <l>Thus Sir, they'l melt your Oar, tho not Refine; </l>
          <l>While each rich Thought of yours, each massey Line, </l>

          <head>To Sir FRANCIS FANE, on his Admirable Play, the SACRIFICE. </head>
          <l>WE have of late with heedless Scenes been fed, </l>
          <l>With Plays fit only to be seen, not read, </l>
          <l>As tho with Rochester all Sence were dead; </l>
          <l>But when that <hi>Prince of Wit </hi>did yield to death, </l>
          <l>As his best Legacy, he did bequeath </l>
          <l>To you, his Friend, his great Poetick Power, </l>
          <l>And in it nam'd you for his Successour. </l>
          <l>Strait Wit's great Council sate, that Critick Tribe, </l>
          <l>Who did your Title to the Gift subscribe; </l>
          <l>And by their Heralds did aloud declare </l>
          <l>To all the World you were his lawful Heir▪ </l>
          <l>And now to satisfie pretending Men, </l>
          <l>You have confirm'd your Title by your Pen. </l>
          <l>For by your charming measures you have taught, </l>
          <l>You do inherit that dear thing call'd Thought. </l>
          <l>Cease then ye Factious Wits, and never dare </l>
          <l>Attempt the Laurel from his Head to tare; </l>
          <l>For whilst he doth Wit's Glorious Scepter sway, </l>
          <l>Ye cannot happier be than to obey; </l>
          <l>And if against his Laws ye ne'r rebel, </l>
          <l>Both Italy and France, </l>
          <l>We shall in Wit as well as Arms excel. </l>
          <l>Then Sir, how much is due t'you from the Age </l>
          <l>That you your Learned Thoughts should thus engage </l>
          <l>Once more to send a Pattern to the Stage? </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000572-005-a"/>
          <l>A Play correct, where Art and Nature's shown, </l>
          <l>That's self Existent, and depends on none; </l>
          <l>Where Wit, like Souls in Bodies, by your Art </l>
          <l>Is all in all, and all in ev'ry part. </l>
          <l>Shou'd Traiterous Whiggs but view the lasting Dress </l>
          <l>That you've put on Ragalzan's Wickedness, </l>
          <l>Tho hatred to the best of Kings they wear, </l>
          <l>Yet all designs against him they'd forbear, </l>
          <l>Lest you shou'd make them your next Character. </l>
          <l>For well 'tis known that whatsoe'r you write </l>
          <l>Will see the Sun till all things end in Night. </l>
          <l>And tho these Villains Rope nor Ax do fear, </l>
          <l>Yet everlasting Shame they cannot bear. </l>
          <l>If happy Souls above can view the State </l>
          <l>Of things below, Despina for her Fate </l>
          <l>Will thank the Gods, now to her Virtuous Name, </l>
          <l>Your well wrought Lines have given a happy Fame: </l>
          <l>Irene too, that Pious Beauteous Prize </l>
          <l>No more wou'd blame the Effects of her dear Eyes, </l>

          <l>And every Little Critick's senseless rage, </l>
          <l>Damn'd a forsaken, self-declining Stage. </l>
          <l>Great, 'tis confess'd, and many are our Crimes; </l>

          <l>Our best of Rules, and best Example too. </l>
          <l>Precepts and grave Instructions dully move; </l>
          <l>The brave Performer better does Improve. </l>
          <l>Thus in the truest Saryr you Excel, </l>

          <l>At once her wilful haughty Soul Engage: </l>
          <l>And while her Rigid Honor we Esteem, </l>
