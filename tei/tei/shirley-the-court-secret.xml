        <p>THE Character of true Nobilitie is sacred, and indeleble; that Yours is such, needeth no Testimony, the World <pb xml:id="ep000751-203-a"/>bearing witnesse to Your Honourable Mind, upon which all other accesse of Titles wait like a fair Train of Attendance, not Ornaments, Your own Virtue giving them lustre, and enterteining them as Rewards payd down to Your Person, and Merit. </p>
        <p>This Principle, gave me boldnesse to make this approach to Your Lordship, and not without some design in my Ambition, to renew my self to Your smile, who have enjoyed the happinesse (many yeares since) to kisse Your hand, and to observe with Admiration the Beauties that shin'd upon Your Youth, which as they gained upon Time, so they have grown <pb xml:id="ep000751-203-b"/>above the prejudice of Opinion, and improv'd their Maturitie by the Earlinesse of their Spring. </p>
        <p>But my humble duty (my Lord) at this fortunate hour to attend You, cometh not alone, it bringeth a Present, such as my weak condition could reach to; a Poem, one, that weareth no Ribbands in the forehead; not so much as warranted by Applause; for it happened to receive birth, when the Stage was interdicted, and wanted that publique Seal which other Compositions enjoyed; Though it hath been read and honour'd with the Allowance of some men, whose Opinion was as acceptable to mee, as the <pb xml:id="ep000751-204-a"/>Vote of a smiling Theater. </p>
        <p>But this is not to prescribe to your Honour, whom I have by this Application made my Iudge (should You wave the Patron) and from whom there lyes no Appeal. </p>
        <p>If your Honour, descending from your higher Contemplations, vouchsafe to look upon these Papers, though Your Iustice should condemn them, it would bee their Reputation to fall by so Honourable a Sentence: But if they happen to obtain Your Lordships favour, that they may live, your Name will not onely bee a powerfull defence to them, but a lasting Record of <pb xml:id="ep000751-204-b"/>Honour upon the Composer, whose heart is full of Devotions to your Lordship, and ambitious of no greater addition, than to be known, </p>
