        <l>CIcero in his book de amicitia these woords dooth expresse, </l>
        <l>Saying nothing is more desirous then like is vnto like: </l>
        <l>Whose woords are most true and of a certainty doubtles, </l>
        <l>For the vertuous doo not the vertuous company mislike. </l>
        <l>But the vicious dooth the vertuous company eschue: </l>
        <l>And like wil vnto like this is most true. </l>
        <l>It is not my meaning your eares for to wery, </l>
        <l>with harkning what is the effect of our matter: </l>
        <l>But our pretence is to mooue you to be mery, </l>
        <l>Merily to speak meaning no man to flatter. </l>
        <l>The name of this matter as I said while ere, </l>
        <l>is like wil to like quod the Deuil to the Collier. </l>
        <l>Sith pithie prouerbs in our English sung doo abound, </l>
        <l>Our author thought good such a one for to chuse: </l>
        <l>As may shew good example and mirth may eke b√© found, </l>
        <l>But no lasciuious toyes he purposeth to vse, </l>
        <l>Heerin as it were in a glasse see you may: </l>
        <l>the aduauncement of vertue and of vice the decay, </l>
        <l>To what ruin ruffins and roisters are brought, </l>
        <l>You may heer see of them the finall end: </l>
        <l>Begging is the best though that end be naught. </l>
        <l>But hanging is woorse if they doo not amend. </l>
        <l>The vertuous life is brought to honor and dignitie: </l>
        <l>And at the last to euerlasting eternitie. </l>
        <l>And because diuers men of diuers mindes be, </l>
        <l>Some doo matters of mirth and pastime require: </l>
        <l>Other some are delighted with matters of grauitie. </l>
        <l>to please all men is our authors cheef desire. </l>
        <l>Wherfore mirth with mesure to sadnes is annexed, </l>
        <l>Desiring that none heer at our matter wil be parplexed. </l>
        <l>Thus as I said I wil be short and breef, </l>
        <l>Because that from this dump you shall rel√©eued be: </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000021-003-a"/>
        <l>And the Deuil with the Colier, the theef that seeks the theef, </l>
        <l>Shall soon make you merry as shortly you shall see. </l>
        <l>And sith mirth for sadnes is a sauce most sweet: </l>
        <l>take mirth then with measure that best sauceth it. </l>
