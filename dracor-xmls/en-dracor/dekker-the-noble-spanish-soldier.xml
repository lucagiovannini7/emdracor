        <p>VNderstanding Reader, I present this to your view, which has received applause in Action. The Poet might conceive a compleat satisfaction upon the Stages approbation: But the Printer rests not there, knowing that that which was acted and approved upon the Stage, might bee no lesse acceptable in Print. It is now communicated to you whose leisure and knowledge admits of reading and reason: Your Iudgement now this Posthumus assures himselfe will well attest his predecessors endevours to give content to men of the ablest quality, such as intelligent readers are here conceived to be. I could have troubled you with a longer Epistle, but I feare to stay <pb xml:id="ep000235-003-a"/>you from the booke, which affords better words and matter than I can. So the work modestly depending in the skale of your Iudgement, the Printer for his part craves your pardon, hoping by his promptnesse to doe you greater service, as conveniency shall enable him to give you more or better testimony of his entirenesse towards you. </p>
