          <l>GAllants, I vow I am quite out of heart, </l>
          <l>I've not one smutty Iest in all my part. </l>
          <l>Here's not one Scene of tickling Rallery; </l>
          <l>There we quite lose the Pit and Gallery, </l>
          <l>His <hi>London Cuckolds </hi>did afford you sport. </l>
          <l>That pleas'd the Town, and did divert the Court. </l>
          <l>But 'cause some squeamish Females of renown </l>
          <l>Made visits with design to cry it down, </l>
          <l>He swore in's Rage he would their humors fit, </l>
          <l>And write the next without one word of Wit. </l>
          <l>No Line in this will tempt your minds to Evil, </l>
          <l>It's true, 'tis dull, but then 'tis very civil. </l>
          <l>No double sense shall now your thoughts beguile, </l>
          <l>Make Lady Blush, nor Ogling Gallant Smile. </l>
          <l>But mark the Fate of this mis-judging Fool! </l>
          <l>A Bawdy Play was never counted Dull, </l>
          <l>Nor modest Comedy e're pleas'd you much, </l>
          <l>'Tis relish'd like good Manners 'mongst the Dutch. </l>
          <l>In you, Chast Ladies, then we hope to day, </l>
          <l>This is the Poets Recantation Play </l>
          <l>Come often to't that he at length may see </l>
          <l>'Tis more than a pretended Modesty </l>
          <l>Stick by him now, for if he finds you falter, </l>
          <l>He quickly will his way of writing alter; </l>
          <l>And every Play shall send you blushing home, </l>
          <l>For, tho you rail, yet then we're sure you'll come, </l>
          <l>Thus Brides are Coy and Bashful the first night, </l>
          <l>But us'd to't once, are mad for their delight. </l>
          <l>Do not the Whiggish Nature then pursue, </l>
          <l>Lest like Whig-Writer, he desert you too. </l>
          <l>Whig-Poet when he can no longer Thrive, </l>
          <l>Turns <hi>Cat in Pan </hi>and writes his Narrative. </l>
          <l>No Irish Witness sooner shall recant, </l>
          <l>Nor oftner play the Devil or the Saint. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE, </head>
        <byline>Spoken by Mr. IEVORN. </byline>
        <lg>
          <l>THo I am no great Conjurer you see, </l>
          <l>Nor deal in Devil or Astrology, </l>
          <l>Yet from your Physnomies I shrewdly guess▪ </l>
          <l>The Poet stole the <hi>French Divineress</hi>. </l>
          <l>But let not that, pray, put you in a passion, </l>
          <l>Kidnapping has of late been much in fashion: </l>
          <l>If Alderman did Spirit men away, </l>
          <l>Why may not Poets then Kidnap a Play? </l>
          <l>Poets are Planters, Stage is their Plantation; </l>
          <l>But tho they are for Trade and Propagation, </l>
          <l>Yet don't like <hi>Thievish Whiggs </hi>Rob their own Nation. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>But, Fellow Citizens, beware Entrapping, </l>
          <l>For, whil'st y'are busie sending Folks to Wapping, </l>
          <l>‛ Ygad your Wives e'ne go abroad Kidnapping. </l>
          <l>Tending to this, of late I heard such stories, </l>
          <l>That I▪ for safety Marry'd 'mongst the Tories. </l>
          <l>And see from City Prigg I am become </l>
          <l>A <hi>Beau Garcon</hi>, a man of th' <hi>Sword: rare Thumb</hi>! </l>
          <l>Jerné I am all Tory now, <hi>par ma foy </hi>
          </l>
          <l>I hate a Whigg: I'm l'Officiere du Roy. </l>
          <l>And now I bid defiance to the City, </l>
          <l>Nor Whigg, nor Critick shall from me have pitty. </l>
          <l>And as in Valour, I in Wit am grown, </l>
          <l>Then to'em Gillet; let'em know their own. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <pb xml:id="ep000698-040-a"/>
          <l>You Whiggs, but Criticks are amongst the Cits. </l>
          <l>And Criticks are meer Whiggs amongst the Wits. </l>
          <l>Thro your cross Nature you l no mercy show, </l>
          <l>But would the Monarchy of Wit o're-throw; </l>
          <l>
            <hi>And Criticks </hi>here with the same spirit stickle </l>
          <l>〈…〉, as Whiggs in Conventicle. </l>
          <l>〈◊〉 Sheriffs and Poets equally you ●…ul </l>
          <l>〈…〉 in a Play-House, they ●… Guild-Hall. </l>
          <l>〈◊〉 Noise, you see, and Faction often fails, </l>
          <l>〈◊〉 is our Shield against your <hi>Prot'stant Flails</hi>. </l>
          <l>Law and large Fines may send you all to Iails. </l>
          <l>And if you Criticks here are troublesome </l>
          <l>I'le Diametrically upon you come, </l>
          <l>And 〈◊〉 you with my Charm, <hi>Firm, Close▪ Standfast Thumb! </hi>
          </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Then there's your Wheadling Critick, seems a Friend, </l>
          <l>Commends by halves; and with a But i'th▪ end, </l>
          <l>Has sly reserves which still to Faction tend. </l>
          <l>They praise a Play, and on the Poet fleer, </l>
          <l>But, his back turn'd, loll out their tongue and Ieer. </l>
          <l>Thus amongst Wits, as Whiggs too, these are Trimmers, </l>
          <l>They'r like a sort of <hi>Half Crowns </hi>we call Swimmers. </l>
          <l>Broad to the Eye, but though the Stamp seems fair </l>
          <l>Weigh 'em they're light, and damn'd <hi>mixt Metal </hi>are. </l>
          <l>These blame the City, but uphold their Charter, </l>
          <l>They Rail at Treason, but give Traitors Quarter, </l>
          <l>And when a Rebel's hang'd, they stile him Martyr. </l>
          <l>For <hi>Perjur'd Villains </hi>they wou'd have Reprieve, </l>
          <l>And to <hi>False Witnesses </hi>can Pensions give, </l>
          <l>Yet won't allow a Mayor may choose his Sheriff. </l>
          <l>They cry, to Magistrates we'll give all Honor: </l>
          <l>But let's have Law:— Then Holloo— take him Coroner. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>But, Friends, don't think that you shall longer Sham us, </l>
          <l>Or that we'll Bugbear'd be by your Mandamus; </l>
          <l>〈◊〉 see Dame Dobsons Devil long was famous, </l>
          <l>fail'd at last: so will your Ignoramus. </l>
