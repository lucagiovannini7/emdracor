          <salute>MADAM, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>_ THE Privilege of Poetry (or it may be the Vanity of the Pretenders to it) has given 'em a kind of Right to pretend, at the same time, to the Favour of those, whom <pb xml:id="ep000854-004"/>their high Birth and excellent Qualities have plac'd in a very distinguishing manner above the rest of the World. If this be not a receiv'd Maxim, yet I am sure I am to wish it were, that I may have at least some kind of Excuse for laying this Tragedy at Your Grace's Feet. I have too much reason to fear that it may prove but an indifferent Entertainment to Your Grace, since if I have any way succeeded in it, it has been in describing those violent Passions which have been always Strangers to so happy a Temper, and so noble and so exalted a Virtue as Your Grace is Mistress of. Yet for all this, I cannot but confess the Vanity which I have, to hope that there may be something so moving in the Misfortunes and Distress of the Play, as may be not altogether unworthy of Your Grace's Pity. This is one of the main Designs of Tragedy, and to <pb xml:id="ep000854-005"/>excite this generous Pity in the greatest Minds, may pass for some kind of Success in this way of Writing. I am sensible of the Presumption I am guilty of by this Hope, and how much it is that I pretend to in Your Grace's Approbation; if it be my good Fortune to meet with any little Share of it, I shall always look upon it as much more to me than the general Applause of the Theatre, or even the Praise of a good Critick. Your Grace's Name is the best Protection this Play can hope for, since the World, ill-natur'd as it is, agrees in an universal Respect and Deference for Your Grace's Person and Character. In so censorious an Age as this is, where Malice furnishes out all the Publick Conversations, where every Body pulls and is pull'd to pieces of course, and where there is hardly such a thing as being merry, but at another's Expence; yet by a <pb xml:id="ep000854-006"/>publick and uncommon Justice to the Dutchess of <hi>Ormond, </hi>Her Name has never been mention'd, but as it ought, tho' She has Beauty enough to provoke Detraction from the Fairest of Her own Sex, and Virtue enough to make the Loose and Dissolute of the other (a very formidable Party) Her Enemies. Instead of this they agree to say nothing of Her but what She deserves, That Her Spirit is worthy of Her Birth; Her Sweetness, of the Love and Respect of all the World; Her Piety, of Her Religion; Her Service, of Her Royal Mistress; and Her Beauty and Truth, of Her Lord; that in short every part of Her Character is Just, and that She is the best Reward for one of the greatest Hero's this Age has produc'd. This, Madam, is what You must allow People every where to say; those whom You shall leave behind You in England will have something further to <pb xml:id="ep000854-007"/>add, the Loss we shall suffer by your Grace's Journey to <hi>Ireland; </hi>the Queen's Pleasure, and the Impatient Wishes of that Nation are about to deprive us of Two of our Publick Ornaments. But there is no arguing against Reasons so prevalent as these. Those who shall lament your Grace's Absence will yet acquiesce in the Wisdom and Justice of Her Majesty's Choice: Among all whose Royal Favours none cou'd be so agreeable, upon a thousand Accounts, to that People, as the Duke of <hi>Ormond. </hi>With what Joy, what Acclamations shall they meet a Governor, who beside their former Obligations to His Family, has so lately ventur'd His Life and Fortune for their Preservation; What Duty, what Submission shall they not pay to that Authority which the Queen has delegated to a Person so dear to 'em? And with what Honour, what Respect shall they receive Your Grace, when they look <pb xml:id="ep000854-008"/>upon You as the Noblest and Best Pattern Her Majesty cou'd send 'em, of her own Royal Goodness, and Personal Virtues? They shall behold Your Grace with the same Pleasure the English shall take when ever it shall be their good Fortune to see You return again to Your Native Country. In England Your Grace is become a Publick Concern, and as Your going away will be attended with a general Sorrow, so Your Return shall give as general a Joy; and to none of those many, more than to, </p>

        <lg>
          <l>LONG has the Fate of Kings and Empires been </l>
          <l>The common Business of the Tragick Scene, </l>
          <l>As if Misfortune made the Throne her Seat, </l>
          <l>And none cou d be unhappy but the Great. </l>
          <l>Dearly 'tis true each buys the Crown he wears, </l>
          <l>And many are the mighty Monarch's Cares: </l>
          <l>By foreign Foes and home-bred Factions prest, </l>
          <l>Few are the Joys he knows and short his Hours of Rest. </l>
          <l>Stories like these with Wonder we may hear, </l>
          <l>But far remote and in a higher Sphere, </l>
          <l>We ne'er can pity what we ne'er can share. </l>
          <l>Like distant Battles of the Pole and <hi>Swede, </hi>
          </l>
          <l>Which frugal Citizens o'er Coffee read, </l>
          <l>Careless for who shall fail or who succeed. </l>
          <l>Therefore an humbler Theme our Author chose, </l>
          <l>A melancholy Tale of private Woes: </l>
          <l>No Princes here lost Royalty bemoan, </l>
          <l>But you shall meet with Sorrows like your own; </l>
          <l>Here see imperious Love his Vassals treat, </l>
          <l>As hardly as Ambition does the Great; </l>
          <l>See how succeeding Passions rage by turns, </l>
          <l>How fierce the Youth with Joy and Rapture burns, </l>
          <l>And how to Death for Beauty lost, he mourns. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Let no nice Taste the Poet's Art arraign, </l>
          <l>If some frail vicious Characters he feign: </l>
          <l>Who Writes shou'd still let Nature be his Care, </l>
          <l>Mix Shades with Lights and not paint all things fair, </l>
          <l>But shew you Men and Women as they are. </l>
          <l>With Deference to the Fair he bad me say, </l>
          <l>Few to Perfection ever found the Way; </l>
          <l>Many in many Parts are known t' excel, </l>
          <l>But 'twere're too hard for One to act all well; </l>
          <l>Whom justly Life should through each Scene commend, </l>
          <l>The Maid, the Wife the Mistress, and the Friend: </l>
          <l>This Age, 'tis true has one great Instance seen, </l>
          <l>And Heav'n in Justice made that One a Queen. </l>

          <l>YOU see the tripping Dame could find no Favour, </l>
          <l>Dearly she paid for Breach of good Behaviour, </l>
          <l>Nor could her loving Husband's Fondness save her. </l>
          <l>Italian Ladies lead but scurvy Lives, </l>
          <l>There's dreadful dealing with Eloping Wives; </l>
          <l>Thus 'tis, because these Husbands are obey'd </l>
          <l>By force of Laws, which for themselves they made, </l>
          <l>With Tales of old Prescriptions they confiae, </l>
          <l>The Right of Marriage-rule to their Male Line, </l>
          <l>And Hust, and Domineer by Right Divine, </l>
          <l>Had we the Pow'r we'd make the Tyrants know, </l>
          <l>What 'tis to fail in Duties which they owe; </l>
          <l>We'd teach the saunt'ring Squire, who loves to roam, </l>
          <l>Forgetful of his own dear Spouse and Home; </l>
          <l>Who Snores at Night supinely by her side, </l>
          <l>'Twas not for this the Nuptial Knot was ty'd. </l>
          <l>The plodding Petty-fogger, and the Cit, </l>
          <l>Have learn'd at least this Modern way of Wit: </l>
          <l>Each ill-bred, senseless Rogue, tho' ne'er so dull, </l>
          <l>Has th' Impudence to think his Wife a Fool; </l>
          <l>He spends the Night, where merry Wags resort, </l>
          <l>With joking Clubs, and Eighteen-penny Port, </l>
          <l>While she poor Soul's contented to regale, </l>
          <l>By a sad Sea-cole Fire, with Wigs and Ale. </l>

          <l>And fill an absent Husband's empty place: </l>
          <l>If you would e'er bring Constancy in Fashion, </l>
          <l>You Men must first begin the Reformation. </l>
          <l>Then shall the Golden Age of Love return, </l>
          <l>No Turtle for her wand'ring Mate shall mourn, </l>
          <l>No Foreign Charms shall cause Domestick Strife, </l>

          <l>Phillis shall not be to the Country sent, </l>
          <l>For Carnivals in Town to keep a tedious <hi>Lent: </hi>
          </l>
          <l>Lampoons shall cease, and envious Scandal die, </l>
