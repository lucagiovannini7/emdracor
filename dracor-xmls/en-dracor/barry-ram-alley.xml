        <l>HOme-bred mirth our Muse doth sing, </l>
        <l>The Satyres tooth and Waspish sting, </l>
        <l>Which most do hurt when least suspected, </l>
        <l>By this Play are not affected; </l>
        <l>But if Conceit with quick-turn'd Sceanes, </l>
        <l>Obseruing all those ancient streames, </l>
        <l>Which from the Horse-foot fount do flow, </l>
        <l>As Time, Place, Person, and to show, </l>
        <l>Things neuer done with that true life, </l>
        <l>That thoughts and wits shall stand at strife, </l>
        <l>Whether the things now shewne be true, </l>
        <l>Or whether wee our selues now do </l>
        <l>The things wee but present: if these </l>
        <l>Free from the loathsome stage disease, </l>
        <l>(So ouer-worne, so tirde and stale, </l>
        <l>Not Satyring but to raile,) </l>
        <l>May win your fauours, and inherit </l>
        <l>But calme acceptance for his merit: </l>
        <l>A vowes by Paper, Pen and Inke, </l>
        <l>And by the learned Sisters drinke, </l>
        <l>To spend his Time, his Lamps, his Oyle, </l>
        <l>And neuer cease his braine to toyle, </l>
        <l>Till from the silent houres of night, </l>
        <l>Hee doth produce for your delight, </l>
        <l>Conceits so new, so harmlesse free, </l>
        <l>That Puritanes them-selues may see </l>
        <l>A Play, yet not in publique Preach, </l>
        <l>That Players such lewd doctrine teach </l>
        <l>That their pure ioynts do quake and tremble, </l>
        <l>When they doe see a man resemble </l>
        <l>The Picture of a Villaine: This </l>
