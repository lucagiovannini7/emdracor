          <hi>To His GRACE WILLIAM Duke of </hi>Devonshire; Lord Steward of Her Majesty's Houshold, Lord in <hi>Eyre, </hi>North of <hi>Trent, </hi>Lord Lieutenant of the County of <hi>Derby; </hi>and One of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, <hi>&amp;c. </hi>

        <p>THE Muses were ever ambitious of being distinguish'd, by shrouding themselves under the Patronage of the greatest Men in all Ages; not made so by Titles or Preferment; but such, whose innate Principles of Honour, truly supported those their Prince had crown'd them with. From hence sprung my Presumption of laying the following Scenes at Your Grace's Feet; since the World must allow, that all those Virtues, which compleat a perfect good, as well as great Man, are <pb xml:id="ep000853-003"/>center'd in the Duke of Devonshire; the loyalest Subject, the tenderest Husband, and the kindest Master, that ever Monarch, Wife, or Servant had; Briliant Graces, but such as do not shine in every Man of Quality. From such Patriots, what may not Britain hope? Nay, what might not She command, were all her Sons as fervent for her Interest, and discharg'd their respective Trusts with that Fidelity, and due Regard to the publick Good, as Your Grace has ever done in Yours: Then the hated Name of Faction wou'd be heard no more, and the scandalous Wounds of hot-headed Parties heal'd; which is the only way to secure this Island from foreign Insults, and establish Peace more firmly, than Armies, tho' vast as Xerxes led, can do. </p>
        <p>To attempt your Grace's Character, is the superiour business of a Masculine Pen, and not to be reach'd by mine: But since my Husband has the Honour to serve Her Majesty, under the Command of Your Grace, as he did the late King of glorious Memory, under that of your noble Father, I cou'd not be prevail'd upon to alter my <pb xml:id="ep000853-004"/>Resolution of prefixing your Grace's Name in the front of this Poem, at once to shew my Gratitude, and my Ambition: And if, when Your Grace's Mind's unbended from the Care and Business of the State, it finds the way in some leisure Hour to divert Your Grace, and the Author meet your Pardon for this Liberty, my Wishes are all answer'd; as I hope my Prayers will be, that Your Grace may enjoy a perfect Health, free from Pain in Mind, and Body; and see as many flourishing happy New Years, as your best and dearest Friends can desire; and every one add fresh Honours to those that are so deservedly worn by Your Grace at present, which are the earnest Wishes of </p>

        <head>THE PREFACE. </head>
        <p>I Shou'd not have troubled my Courteous Reader with a Preface, had I not lain under the Necessity of Clearing my self of what some People have been pleas'd to charge me with, viz. of being the Author of a Paper call'd, <hi>The Female Tattler, </hi>consequently of a Paragraph in that of the 14th Instant, relating to this Comedy; tho' I think no reasonable Person will believe I could be guilty of so much Folly. Tho' Vanity is said to be the darling Vice of Womankind, yet nothing but an Idiot wou'd express themselves so openly; and I hope the World won't think me guilty of Printing, what I must blush to Read, nor imagine it Wrote even by any Friend of mine, for two Reasons; First, the Grossness of the Flattery. Secondly, the Injury it must of course do me, in the Run of my Play, by putting those People out of Humour, whose Action was to give Life to the Piece. I suppose these Reasons are sufficient to convince the Judicious part, that I was no ways concerned in those Reflections, but own I was treated with all the seeming Civility in the World, till the second Night of my Comedy. I willingly submitted to Mr. Cibber's Superiour Judgment in shortning the Scene of the Ghost in the last Act, and believed him perfectly in the Right, because too <pb xml:id="ep000853-006"/>much Repetition is tiresome. Indeed when Mr. Estcourt slic'd most of it out, I cou'd not help interposing my Desires to the contrary, which the rest readily comply'd with; and I had the Satisfaction to see I was not deceiv'd in my Opinion, of its pleasing. This Passage I happen'd to mention among my Acquaintance; for 'tis Natural to have a kind of a Tender for our own Productions, but especially if they have the good Fortune to divert others. Now, if from this the Author of the Tattler gather'd his Account, I am guilty of speaking, but not designedly; for who they are that Write that Paper, or how Distinguish'd, I am perfectly ignorant, and declare I never was concern'd, either in Writing, or Publishing, any of the <hi>Tattlers. </hi>
        </p>
        <p>I never had the Vanity to think, much less to publish, that any thing I am capable of doing, cou'd support the Stage, tho' I have had the good Fortune to please, or to find the Town willing to be pleas'd; tho' at present it seems a certain Author has enter'd a Caveat against all Plays running to a sixth Night, but his own. Tho' an Opera interfer'd with this Comedy, yet it brought above Forty Pounds the second Night, which shew'd it had some Merit; for I have known many a Play kept up, that fail'd of half that Money the second Night. Now by the Rules of the House, it ought to have been play'd on: But who can secure the Life of a Play, when that of a Man is often Sacrific'd to the Malice of Parties? This Play met with a kind Reception in general, and notwithstanding the Disadvantages it had to struggle with, by raising the Prices the first Day, and the Nearness of <hi>Christmas, </hi>it would have made its way to a sixth Night, if it had had fair Play. Mistake <pb xml:id="ep000853-007"/>me not, I do not mean from the Representation; for I must do the Players Reason: Had I search'd all the Theatres in the World, I cou'd not have selected a better Company, nor had more Justice done me in the Action, tho' they have not dealt honourably by me in my Bargain; for they ought not to have stop'd the Run, upon any Pique whatever. 'Tis small Encouragment to Write for the Stage, when the Actors, according to the Caprice of their Humours, mangre the Taste of the Town, have power to sink the Reputation of a Play; for if they resolve not to Act it, the Town can't support it. </p>
        <p>Well, if there is any Merit in suffering wrongfully, I shall find my Account in't one time or other; in the mean while I intreat the <hi>Female Tattler </hi>to be Witty no more at my Expence. I desire I may not be rank'd in the Number of those that support the Stage, since the Stage is become a Noun Substantive, and resolves to shew it is able to stand by itself. </p>

          <hi>PROLOGUE. </hi>By a GENTLEMAN. Spoken by Mr. <hi>WILKS. </hi>
        </head>
        <l>OUR Female Author trembling stands within, </l>
        <l>Her Fear arises from another's Sin; </l>
        <l>One of her Sex has so abus'd the Town, </l>
        <l>That on her Score she dreads your angry Frown: </l>
        <l>Tho' I dare say, poor Soul, she never writ </l>
        <l>Lampoon, or Satyr on the Box or Pit; </l>
        <l>A harmless hum'rous Play is her Extent of Wit. </l>
        <l>Tho' Bickerstaff's vast Genius may engage, </l>
        <l>And lash the Vice and Follies of the Age; </l>
        <l>Why shou'd tender Delia tax the Nation? </l>
        <l>Stickle, and make a Noise for Reformation, </l>
        <l>Who always gave a Loose, her self, to Inclination. </l>
        <l>Scandal and Satyr's thrown aside to Day, </l>
        <l>And Humour the sole Business of our Play. </l>
        <l>Beaux may dress on to catch the Ladies Hearts, </l>
        <l>And good Assurance pass for mighty Parts: </l>
        <l>The Citts may bring their Spouses without Fear, </l>
        <l>We shew no Wife that's poaching for an Heir, </l>
        <l>Nor teach the Use of fine Gause Handkercheir. </l>
        <l>Cowards may huff, and talk of mighty Wonders, </l>
        <l>And Jilts set up‚Äî for Twenty thousand Pounders. </l>
        <l>Our Author, even tho' she knows full well, </l>
        <l>Is so Good-natur'd, she forbears to tell </l>
        <l>What Collonels, lately, have found out the Knack </l>
        <l>To Muster Madam, still, by <hi>Ned, </hi>or <hi>Jack, </hi>
        </l>
        <l>To keep their Pleasures up; a Frugal way, </l>
        <l>They give her‚Äî Subaltern's Subsistance for her Pay. </l>
        <l>In short, what e'er your Darling Vices are, </l>
        <l>They pass untouch'd in this Night's Bill of Fare. </l>
        <l>But if all this can't your good Nature wake, </l>
        <l>Tho' here and there, a Scene shou'd fail to take, </l>
        <l>Yet spare her for the Busie-Body's sake. </l>

        <l>Beside, their Haggling Passions never gain, </l>
        <l>Beyond the Passage-walking Nymphs of <hi>Drury-Lane: </hi>
        </l>
        <l>And then the Pit's more stock'd with Rakes and Rovers, </l>
        <l>Than any of these senseless, whining Lovers. </l>
        <l>The Backs o' th' Boxes too seem mostly lin'd </l>
        <l>With Souls, whose Passion's to themselves confin'd. </l>
        <l>I‚óè s‚óèort, I can't perceive, 'mongst all you Sparks, </l>

        <l>First then, Beware you prove no Spark in Red, </l>
        <l>With empty Purse, and Regimental Head; </l>
        <l>That thinks no Woman can refuse t'engage in't, </l>

        <l>That swears he'll settle from his Joy's commencing, </l>
        <l>And make the Babe, the Day he's Born, an Ensign. </l>
        <l>Nor cou'd I bear a Titl'd Beau, that steals </l>
        <l>From fasting Spouse her Matrimonial Meals; </l>
        <l>That Modish sends next Morn to her Apartment, </l>
        <l>A Civil How-deye‚Äî far alas! from th' Heart meant: </l>
        <l>Then Powder'd for th' ensuing Day's Delights, </l>
        <l>Bows thro' his Croud of Duns, and drives to White's. </l>
        <l>Nor cou'd I like the Wretch, that all Night plays, </l>
        <l>And only takes his Rest on Winning Days; </l>
        <l>That sets up from a lucky Hit, his Rattler </l>
