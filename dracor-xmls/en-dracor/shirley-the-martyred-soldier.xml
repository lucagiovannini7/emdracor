        <p>WOrkes of this Nature, may fitly be compared to small and narrow rivolets, that at first derive themselves to greater Rivers, and afterwards are discharged into the maine Ocean: So Poesie rising from obscure and almost unminded beginnings, hath often advanc'd it Selfe, even to the thrones of Princes: witnesse that ever-living Worke of renowned Virgil, so <pb n="eebo_img-3" xml:id="ep000262-012"/>much admired and favoured by magnificent Augustus: Nor can I much wonder that great men, and those of Excellent parts, have so often preferred Poesie, it being indeed, the sweetest and best speaker of all Noble Actions. </p>
        <p>Nor were they wont in ancient times to preferre those their Workes to them they best knew, but vnto some Person highly endued with Vallour, Learning, and such other Graces, as render one man farre more Excellent then many others. And this, I hope, may excuse my boldnesse, in this Dedication, being so much a stranger to your Worships knowledge, onely presuming upon your Noble temper, ever apt to cherish well-affected studies. Likewise, this peice seemeth to have <pb n="eebo_img-3" xml:id="ep000262-013"/>a more speciall kind of relation to your Selfe, more then to many others, it being an Exact and perfect patterne of a truly Noble and Warlick Christian. </p>
        <p>When it first appeared upon the Stage, it went off with Applause and favour, and my hope is, it may yeild your Worship, as much content, as my selfe can wish, who ever rest to be commaunded by your worship, </p>

        <head>To the Courteous Reader. </head>
        <p>TO make too large an explanation of this following Poem, were but to beguile thy appetite, and somewhat dull thy expectation; but the worke it selfe being now an Orphant, and wanting him to protect that first begot it, it were an iniury to his memory to passe him unspoken of: For the man, his Muse was much Courted, but no common mistresse; and though but seldome seene abroad, yet ever much admired at: This worke not the meanest of his labours has much adorned not only one, but many Stages, with such a generall applause; <pb n="eebo_img-4" xml:id="ep000262-015"/>as it hath drawne even the Rigid Stoickes of the Time, who though not for pleasure, yet for profit, have gathered something out of his plentifull Vineyard. My hopes are, it wil prove no lesse pleasing to the Reader, then it has formerly beene to the Spectators; and so prooving, I have my aime and full desire, fare-well. </p>

        <head>The Epilogue. </head>
        <l>AS in a Feast, so in a Comedy, </l>
        <l>Two Sences must be pleas'd, in both the Eye. </l>
        <l>In Feasts, the Eye and Taste must be invited, </l>
        <l>In Comedies, the Eye and Eare delighted: </l>
        <l>And he that onely seekes to please but either, </l>
        <l>While both he doth not please, he pleaseth neither: </l>
        <l>What ever Feast, could every guest content: </l>
        <l>When as t'each man, each Taste is different? </l>
        <l>But lesse a Scene, where nought, but as 'tis newer, </l>
        <l>Can please, where Guests are more, and Dishes fewer: </l>
        <l>Yet in this thought, this thought the Author eas'd; </l>
        <l>Who once made all, all but all never pleas'd: </l>
        <l>Faine would we please the best, if not the many, </l>
        <l>And sooner will the best be pleas'd, then any: </l>
        <l>Our rest we set in pleasing of the best: </l>
        <l>So we wish you, what you may give us: Rest. </l>
