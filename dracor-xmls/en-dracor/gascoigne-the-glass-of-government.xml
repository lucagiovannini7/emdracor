        <p>TWo riche Citizens of Andwerpe (beeing nighe neighboures, &amp; hauing eche of them two sonnes of like age) do place them togither with one godly teacher. The scholemaster doth briefly instruct them their duetie towardes God, their Prince, their Parents, their cuntrie, and all magistrates in the same. The eldest being yong men of quicke capacitie, do (Parrotte like) very quickly learne the rules without booke: the yonger beeing somewhat more dull of vnderstanding, do yet engraue the same within their memories. The elder by allurement of Parasites and lewde company, beginne to incline themselues to concupiscence. The parents (to preuent it) sende them all togither to the Vniuersitie of Dowaye, whereas the yonger in short space be (by painefull studie) preferred, that one to be Secretarie vnto the Palsegraue, that other becommeth a famous preacher in Geneua. The eldest (turning to their vomit) take their cariage with them, and trauaile the worlde. That one is apprehended and executed for a robbery (euen in sight of his brother) in the Palsgraues courte: that other whipped and banished Geneua for fornication: notwithstanding the earnest sute of his brother for his pardon. </p>

            <p>It were not reason Phylopaes that hauing so many yeares contineued so neare neighboures, hauing traffiqued (in maner) one selfe same trade, hauing susteyned like aduentures, and being blessed with like successes, we should now in the ende of our time become any lesse then entiere frendes: and as it is the nature and propertie of frendshippe to séeke alwaies for perpetuity, so let vs séeke to bring vp our Children in such mutuall societie in their youth, that in age they may no lesse delight in theyr former felowship, then wée theyr parentes haue taken comfort in our continuall cohabitation. It hath pleased Almighty God to blesse vs both with competent wealth, and though we haue atteyned therevnto by continuall payns and trauayle, rising (as it were) from meane estate, vnto dignity, yet doe I thinke that it were not amisse to bring vp our children with such education as they may excell in knowledge of liberall sciences, for if we being vnlearned <pb xml:id="ep000029-005-a"/>haue by industrie heaped vp sufficient store, not only to serue our owne vse, but further to prouide for our posterity, then may they by learning aspire vnto greater promotion, and builde greater matters vppon a better foundation. Neither yet would I haue you conceiue hereby that I am ambicious.

            <p>I am of your opinion Phylocalus, and since we haue ech of vs two Sonnes of equall age and stature, I would we could be so happie as to finde some honest and carefull schoolemaister, who might enstruct them togither: I say honest, because in the house of the vertuous there is seldome any vice permitted, and carefull, because the care of the teacher is of no lesse consideration then his skill: than do I wish him both honest and carefull, because the coniunction of two such qualities, may both cause the accomplishment of his dutie, &amp; the contentations of our desires. Our eldest Sonnes are neare the age of xxi. yeares, &amp; our younger Sonnes not much more then one yeare behinde them. So that as they haue hitherto bene thought toward enough at such common schooles as they haue frequented, and therefore wil shortly be ready for the vniuersity, yet would I thinke conuenient that they spent some time together, with some such honest and careful Schoolemaister, who might before theyr departure lay a sure foundation to their vnderstanding. </p>

            <p>Now let vs in the holy name of God begin, and he for his mercy geue me grace to vtter, and you to disgest such holesome lessons as may be for the saluation of your soules, the comfort of your lyfe, and the profitte of your Countrey. </p>
            <p>You shall well vnderstand my well beloued schollers, that as God is the author of all goodnesse, so is it requisite that in all traditions and Morall preceptes we begin firste to consider of him, to regard his maiestie, and search the soueraigne poyntes of his Godhead. The Heathen Philosophers (although they had not the light to vnderstand perfect trueth) were yet all of them astonyed at the incomprehensible maiesty and power of God, some of them thought the ayre to be God, some other the earth, some the infinitenesse of things, some one thing, some another, whose opinions I shall passe ouer as thinges vnméete to be much thought of, but by the way, the opinion of Plato is not vnworthy here to bee recited vnto you, who taught plainely that god was omnipotent, by whom the world was made, and al thinges therein created and brought vnto such perfection as they be in. Xenophon affirmed that the true God was inuisible, and that therefore we ought not enquire what or what maner of thing God is. Aristo the Stoicke, affirmed lykewyse that God was incomprehensible. To conclude, Simonides being demaunded what God was, required one dayes respect to answer, and then being again demaunded the same question, he required two dayes respet, at the third apointment of his answere, he came &amp; required thrée dayes, and being demaunded wherefore he did so breake his apointments, and require alwayes further time, he aunswered, that the more déepely that he did consider the matter, the more infinite he found it, and therefore remained alwaies astonyed what to answere, and always craued further time. Truly to leaue the heathen opinions <pb xml:id="ep000029-011-a"/>and to come vnto the very touchestone I thinke it not amisse if we content our selues to thinke that God is omnipotent, and yet his power vnsearchable, and his goodnes vnspeakable. And to be briefe, I wil deliuer vnto you the summe of your dutyes in foure Chapters, the first chapiter shalbe of God and his ministers, the second of the King and his Officers, the third shall conteyne the duties that you owe vnto your Countrey and the Elders thereof, and lastly you shalbe put in remembraunce of your dutyes towardes your Parentes, and what you ought to be of your selues. In these soure chapters I trust (by Gods help) to enclude as much as shalbe necessary for the perfect gouernment of a true Christian. </p>

            <p>Sir wée beseech you that for as much as this order of teaching is both very compendious, &amp; also much different from the lectures which haue bene redde vnto vs, you will therefore vouchsafe to stand somwhat the more vppon euery point, to the end, that aswell your meaning may be perspicuous, as also that we may the better beare away the same, and not onely learne it without the booke, but also engraue it in our mindes. </p>

            <p>Your request is reasonable, and it shalbe by mée as readyly graunted, as it hath bene by you necessarily required. Your first chapter and lesson shall then be, that in all your actions you haue an especiall eye and regard to almighty God, and in that consideration I commend vnto your memory, first God himselfe, and secondarily his ministers. As touching your duties vnto God him self, although they be infinite, yet shall we sufficiently conteine them in thrée especiall poynts to be perfourmed: that is to say, Feare, Loue, &amp; Trust. And first to begin with feare, it shalbe necessary and aboue all thinges your bounden duty, to feare God and his omnipoten power. Linus that auncient Poet wryteth, that with God all thinges are easie to be accomplished, and nothing is vnpossible. Tully in <pb xml:id="ep000029-011-b"/>his Oration Pro Roscio amerino saith, that the commodityes which wée vse, the light which we enioy, and the breath which we haue and drawe, are giuen and bestowed vppon vs by God: then if with God all thinges be possible (according to Linus) he is to be feared, sithens the least part of his displeasure being prouoked, the greatest part of his will is to him right easie to accomplish: and if we haue our light, our lyfe, and all commodities of his gift (as Cicero affirmeth) then is hée to be feared, least with the facillity of his omnipotency he take away as fast as he gaue, or turne light into darknes, life into death, and commodities into discommodities. I might recite you many heathen authorities, but it is most néedlesse, since the very word of God himself, is most plaine in this behalfe, and yet I haue here set downe these fewe, because they are not repugnant to holy Scriptures. Wée finde written in the xx. chapter of Exodus, that God is a Ielous God, and doth visit the sinnes of the Fathers vppon the children vnto the third and fourth generation. Feare him then for he is most mightie. Againe: who shall defend me (saith the Psalmist) vntill thine anger be past? Feare God then, since against his power no defence preuayleth. Again, both the heauens and the earth obay the voice of his mouth. Feare him then for althinges are subiect vnto his mighty power. </p>
            <p>And yet with this feare you must also ioyne loue, for it is not with God as it is with Princes of the worlde, which to make themselues feared do become Tyrantes, but the <ref corresp="A01520-e102350-b" target="A01520-e102350-b"/>
              <note anchored="true" corresp="A01520-e102350-a" place="margin">Loue God. </note>goodnes of almighty God is such, that he desireth no lesse to be loued, then he deserueth to be feared, and though his might and power be vniuersall, and there with all his Ielousie great, and his displeasure soon prouoked, yet delighteth he not in the distruction of mankind, but rather that a sinner should turne from his wickednes and liue. Tully in his second booke de legibus saith, that God being Lord of al things doth deserue best of mankind, bicause he beholdeth <pb xml:id="ep000029-012-a"/>what euery man is, and with what deuotion he worshippeth the Gods, and kéepeth an accompt aswell of the good as the badde: whereby appeareth that the heathen confessed yet that the Gods were to be loued, bycause they cared for mankind, and truly that opinion is neither contrary to Gods word, nor dissonant to naturall reason. For wée sée by common experience that we loue them best of whom we are most fauoured, &amp; haue receiued greatest benefits. I meane hereby those that rule their doinges by reason, for otherwyse wée sée dayly wicked men, which (forgetting their duty) do least loue wher they haue most cause. When I my selfe was a scholler in the Uniuersity, I remember that I did often tymes defend in Schooles this proposition. Ingratitudo (tam versus. 'Deos immortales quam apud homines) peccatum maximum. Ingratitude is the greatest faulte that may be either towards god or man. Let vs consider the good eies of almighty God, who first created vs to his owne Image and similitude, indued vs with reason and knowledge, preserued vs from innumerable perilles, and prouided thinges necessary for our sustentation, and to consider more inwardly the exceeding loue which he bare towardes mankinde, he spared not his onely begotten Sonne, but gaue him (euen vnto the death of the crosse) for our redemption. Oh what minde were able to conceaue, or what tongue able to vtter the loue and goodnes of almighty God towardes mankinde? And since his loue towardes vs, hath bene and yet doth continue infinite, our loue should also be infinite, to render him thanks for his goodnes. But though the causes be infinite which might bind vs to loue GOD, yet is there no cause greater then the manifolde mercyes which he hath shewed alwayes alwayes to mankind. In the first age when iniquity kindled his wrath to destroy the whole world, he yet vouchsafed to preserue Noe and his family, Loue him then since he preserueth the good, though it be but for his mercyes sake, When the people of Israell prouoked <pb xml:id="ep000029-012-b"/>him at sundry times, he did yet at euery submission stay his hand from punishment, Loue God then since he is ready to forgiue, and though he pronounceth his Ielousie in the twentith of Exodus saying, that he visiteth the sinns of the Fathers vppon the children, vnto the third and fourth generation, yet ther withal he addeth, that he sheweth mercy vnto thousandes in them that loue him and kéepe his commaundementes. Loue him then since his mercy is ouer all his works. To conclude, when his vnsearchable Maiestie by his diuine foresight did perceyue, that by the very sentence of the Lawe we stoode all in state of condemnation, he sent down his owne and only Sonne, to be slaundered, buffeted, and crucified for our sinnes, to the ende that all which beléeue in him, should not perish but haue lfie euerlasting. Loue God then since mercy is aboundant with him, and he shall redéeme Israell from all his iniquities. </p>
            <p>And héere vnto this feare and loue you must ioyne a sure <ref corresp="A01520-e102370-b" target="A01520-e102370-b"/>

The promises of mortall men are often times vncertaine, and do fayle, but the promises of the Almighty are vnfallible. For the wordes of his mouth returne not voyd and without effect. Tully in his offices doth vse great arte in declaration what sortes of promises are to be obserued, and which may be broken. But the diuine prouidence and foresight doth promise nothing but that which <ref corresp="A01520-e102380-b" target="A01520-e102380-b"/>

Trust in him then for his woords shall neuer fayle. When he promised Moyses to conduct his people through the desertes, they began to doubt and murmure, saying: would God that we <ref corresp="A01520-e102390-b" target="A01520-e102390-b"/>

            <p>Well then to return vnto the matter, you shall performe vnto the King thrée especial dutyes, that is to say: Honour, Obediencae, and Loue. Hypodamus in his booke of a common welth, saith that a kingdome is a thing compared to the imitation of gods power. Diotogenes the scholler of Pytagoras in his booke of gouernment, saith that a king representeth the figure of God amongst men. Lykewise he sayth, that as god excelleth the most perfect things of nature, so the king excelleth amongst men and worldly matters: so that he is to bee honored as the lieutenant of God here vpon earth, both because he hath power of commaundement, and chiefly because he representeth that heauenly King, who is king of kinges, and aboue all Kynges to be honoured: Euen so is hee also to bee obayed in all seculer constitutions and pollitike prouisions. This obedience doth consequently follow honoure, as the shadow folowes <pb xml:id="ep000029-017-a"/>the body, for whatsoeuer he be that gyueth vnto his king that honor which to him apperteineth, will (no doubt) lykewise obay him with all humilitie. Erasmus teacheth in his Apothegmes, that obedience expelleth al sedition &amp; maynteyneth concorde: the which may also appeare by naturall reason and common experience, neyther shall they euer become able to beare rule them selues, whiche cannot bee content to obay the aucthoritie of others. Wherfore it shal be most conuenient that you obay the King, synce his aucthoritie is from god, &amp; as this obedience dependeth vpon the honour wherewith ye shall reuerence the King as Gods lieutenant, so must you also ioyne therunto an vnfayned loue, for as almightye God is to be loued because hee is mercifull: so the King beeing apoynted by God muste be loued bycause he is thy pretector heere on earth. Salamon sayth, that the kings indignation is the messenger of death, whereby I would frame myne argument from the contrarye, that hee is to be loued, least his indignation being iustly kindled, thou bee not able to beare it. Next vnto the king we are to consider the Magistrates which are appoynted for administration of iustice, and pollityke gouerment: these Magistrates must also bee honoured, obeyed, &amp; loued: honored because they are the substituts of the king vnto whom all honour (on earth) apperteyneth, obeyed because theyr office is appointed by the Kings aucthoritie, and loued because they are the graue and expert personages, which deuise lawes and constitutions for continuaunce of peace and tranquillitie. The apostle Paule in his xiii. chapter of his Epistle to the Romaines, teacheth playnely, that Rulers beare not the sworde in vaine, saying: Let euerie soule be subiect vnto the higher powers, for there is no power but of God. Againe, the ruler (sayth he) doth not beare the sworde in vayne. Wherefore you must néedes be subiect, not onelye for feare, but also for conscience: And Sanct Peter in hys fyrst Epistle and the seconde chapiter, doth sufficientlie <pb xml:id="ep000029-017-b"/>teach vs this point, saying: Submit your selfe vnto all manner ordinaunce of man for the Lordes sake, whether it bee vnto the king as hauing the preheminence, or vnto the rulers as vnto them that are sent of him for the punishment of euill dooers, but for the laude of them that do well. Whereby appeareth, that the magistrates are not onely to be feared, because they punysh offenders, but also to be loued because they cherish the verteous: and for conclusion of this poynt, if you desire to be good men, then learne to performe duety towardes all magistrates. As Sophocles, well sayde, it becommeth a good man to haue due respect vnto all magistrates. I might nowe take your Parentes in hande, for the next pointe of your enstruction but I will first touch the duety which you owe vnto your countrye, and that is conteyned also in three especial pointes: that is to saye, in Thankefulnesse, Defence, and Proffit. And as ingratitude is the most heinous offence against God, so haue I taught you that it is the greatest faulte in humayne actions, amongst the which it sheweth it selfe no way more vntollerable, then if you shoulde happen to bee vnthankefull vnto your country. Tully in his offices sayth, that wee are not borne onely for our owne perticuler cause or profit, but parte (sayth he) our cuntrey challengeth, parte our Parentes think due vnto them, and our friendes ought lykewise to enioye some parte of our trauailes. There are dyuers Philosophers, whiche maynteyne in argument that all cuntryes are frée for a noble mynde, and I agrée thereunto, but yet thereby they conclude not, that a noble minde by chusing a new cuntrey to enhabit, maye lawfully forgett the cuntrey wherein hee was natiue. Zopirus is condempned in all histories, for the vnthankefulnes he vsed in betraying his cuntrey. The truth of the Troyan historie accuseth Aeneas, Antenor, &amp; certeyne others, as most vnthankefull traytors to theyr cuntrey. Cillicon for betraying of Miletus, Lasthenes for deliuering of Olinthus, Nilo for selling of Epirus, and Apollonius <pb xml:id="ep000029-018-a"/>for neglecting of his charge in Samos, are generally noted with the names of vnthankeful and vntrustie traytors to theyr cuntreyes: so that you must alwayes remember to become thankefull to your cuntrey, and myndefull to maynteyne the honor of the same, least neglecting your dueties in that behalfe, you deserue the oprobrious names of traytors, which are odius to God and man. You muste also spare no peril or trauaile to defende the same, for your countrey challengeth not onely that you be thankfull vnto the soyle which hath bredde you, but furder also, that you defende the state, wherein you haue béene nourished. Tully, in his Tusculanes questions recyteth one Lascaena, who when he receiued tydings of his sounes death, whom he had sent into the warres in defence of hys countrey, answered: therefore did I beget him (quoth hee) that hée might be such an one, as woulde not doubt to dye for hys countrey. In his booke entytuled the dreame of Sipio, he affirmeth that there is a certaine place appointed and ordeined in heauen, for all such as defende their countrey. Euripides warneth that we shoulde neuer bee wearye in those trauailes, which tende to the restitution or defence of our countrey. Platoes opinion was, that wee are more bound to defend our countrey, then our own Parents. Like argumentes haue béene defended by many Phylosophers, saying, that although thy Parentes and proper family be ouerthrowne, yet (the common welth of thy cuntrey standing) thou mayst florishe and ryfe againe: but the state of thy countrey being ouerthrowne, both thou and thy Parentes must lykewise come to vtter subuertion. Then as thou shalt fynde it thy bounden duety to honor thy country with all gratitude, and to defende it with all thy power, so must thou likewise endeuor thy selfe to be profitable to the same: whereof many notable examples might be rehersed. Lycurgus, when he had by extréeme dilligence aud trauayle <pb xml:id="ep000029-018-b"/>reduced the Spartanes vnto cyuillytie, by sundrie holsome lawes and pollityke constitutions, and that they began to murmure, saying: that his lawes were vntollerable, hée feyned that he woulde go to Delphos, to consulte with the God Apollo, whether his lawes were to be obserued or not promising to abide his sentence, &amp; requiring no more of the Lacedemonianes, but to sweare that they would obserue those lawes vntill his retourne: which when they had solemly sworne, tooke his iurney without entente to returne home againe, and ordeyned before his death, to be enclosed in a great cheest of Lead, and so to be throwen into the sea, to the ende that hée neuer retourning, the Laucedemonians might be bound by theyr othe to continue the exercise of his profitable lawes, suche care he had to become profitable vnto his countrey. Curtius the Romayne, when there apeared a greate gulfe in the market place, whiche could by no meanes be stopped, and answere was géeuen from the Oracle, that it was onely to bee stopped by that which was of moste worth vnto the citye of Roome, he déeming that the cittie had nothing so precious, as stoute &amp; valyant men, armed him selfe, and leapte into the Gulfe, which stopped immediatly: declaring thereby, howe lyght men ought to estéeme theire life, when as the same maye yelde profitte or commoditie to theyr countrey. Menecius, the Sonne of Craeon, refused not voluntary death, when he vnderstoode that the same might redéeme the citye of Thebes from vtter subuersion. I might trouble you with infinite stories to proue this proposition, but let these few suffice, and in your countrie haue allways especiall respecte to the elders, to whom you must also performe thrée seuerall deuties: that is, Reverence, Loue, and Defence. Lycurgus, ordeyned, that no young man should passe by an elder without reuerence fyrste doone vnto him, namelie if he were set, he rose to do reuerence vnto the elders, and if they were alone, he was bound to proffer them the comfort <pb xml:id="ep000029-019-a"/>of his company. Plato, in his nynth dyalogue of lawes and constitucions doth thus propound: al men must grant (sayth he) that age is much to be preferred before youth, aswell in the sight of God, as also in the sight of men, which will lyue orderly: for it is abhominable (sayth he) that an olde man shoulde geue place vnto an young man, and the Gods them selues do hate it, since youth ought with paciente mynde to beare euen the strypes of their elders. You shal also loue them, because of them you may learne good preceptes, and of them you may be bolde to aske councell: for as Euripides, in his tragedy called Phaenissae, doth teache, prudence will not be gotten with fewe dayes seeking for, and the apostles teach vs our deuty dyrectly in that behalf, who ordeyned amongst them elders in euery congregation, to decyde all matters in controuersie, of whome they were resolued of all doubtes in conscience. It shal also becom you to defend the elders from al vyolence and outrage, since it is a thing as comly and comendable to defende the weake, as it is glorious and tryumphant to ouercome the mightie: whereof I myght recite many famous examples out of the Romain histories, but I will partlie include the same in the dueties which you owe vnto your Parentes, which are also, Honor, Loue, and Reliefe. And of the first parte, although I might bring in sundry worthy examples, yet because the case is of it self familiar, I wil be briefe, and vse no other persuation then the expresse commaundement of God, who biddeth you to honor your Father and Mother, that your dayes maye bée long in the land which the Lord your god hath giuen you. And Sainct Paule in the sixt chapiter of his Epistle to the Ephesians, sayth. Chyldren obay your Parents in the Lord, for that is right and wellpleasing to the Lorde. As he testifieth in the thirde chapiter to the Colossianes, you shall loue them also because you are engendred of their owne fleshe &amp; bloud, as also you may not forget your Mothers paines <pb xml:id="ep000029-019-b"/>in bearing of you, you muste alwaies meditate in your minde, fyrst the cares which they haue had to preserue you from bodily perils in the cradell, from daunger of dampnation by Godly education, from néede and hunger by administring things necessarie, and from vtter destruction by vigillant foresight &amp; Godly care: all these with infinit other things considered, you shall finde your selues bounden by manyfolde occasions to loue your Parentes, and to be assistant vnto them in the necessities of their age. For well sayd that Poet, which affirmed that children were tenderly swadled in their cradels, to the ende they mighte susteyne their aged Parentes and supplie their wantes. Meruelous is the nature of the Storke, which féedeth the damme in age, of whom it selfe receiued nouriture béeing young in the neast. Tully in his booke of the answers of sothsayers sayth, that nature in the beginning hath made an accord betwéene vs and our Parents, so that it were damnable not to cherish them. And to conclude, ther is nothing that can worse become a comon welth, then to sée the youth florish in prosperity which suffer their parents to perish for lack of any commodity. Now that I haue rehearsed vnto you asmuche as I thinke requisit, for the enstruction of your dueties, fyrst towardes god, and his ministers, next to the Kyng and his Magistrates, thirdely to your countrey and the Elders thereof and lastly towardes your Parentes: it shall not be amisse that you remember of your selfe how you are the Temple of God, kéepe your selues holy therefore in your conuersation, and vndefiled, for if our sauiour Christ did rigorously rebuke and expell the buyers &amp; sellers out of the outward Temple, how muche more will hée punishe them which pollute and defile the inwarde Temple of their bodies, and geue ouer their delight to concupiscence and vanities? thus may you for breuitie remember that you. </p>

            <p>IF none other thing were required in a faythfull ensstructor but onely that he should teach his schollers grammer or such other sciences, then with lesser trauaile might wée attayne vnto perfection, sythens Gammer and all the liberal Sciences are by traditions left vnto vs in such sort, that without any greate difficultie the doubt thereof may be resolued: but the Schoole Master which careth for none other thing but onely to make his schollers lerned, may in some respect be compared to the horsecourser, which one lie careth to féede his horse fat, and neuer delighteth to ryde him, manage him, or make him handsome: and when such palfryes come to iorneyng, they are comonly so prouander proude, that they praunce at the fyrst exceedingly, but being put to a long iourney or seruice, they melt their owne greace and are not able to endure trauayle. Euen so the mindes of yong men being onely trained in knowledge of artes, and neuer perswaded in points of moral reformation, become often times so prowde &amp; so headie, that they are caried rather away with a vaine imagination of their owne excellency, then setled in the resolutions which might promoote them vnto dignitie: and wandring so in a vayne glorious oppinion of their owne wit, they do (as it were) founder and cast them selues in their own halter. Such haue sūdrie philosophers bin in time past, who haue so far gone on pilgrimage in their owne peeuish conceits, that they haue not shamed, by a vaine shew of learning to defend such propositions, as seeme most rediculous &amp; estranged from reason. <pb xml:id="ep000029-042-b"/>Anaxagoras defended that snow was black and yet was accompted a philosopher of greate grauitie &amp; iudgement. Pherecydes, prognosticated that an earthquake was at hand, because he saw the water drawen out of a fountayne, and yet was he the Master of Pythagoras, &amp; accompsed a profound phylosopher. Protagoras, also affirmed that men might well affirme all that to bee true, which vnto them seemed true. And infinite others might bee rehersed, whose opinionate iudgementes did eclipse the rest of their comendable capacitie: wherupon also hath sprong the damnable opinion of Atheysts. For the mind of man is so heauenlie a thing and of such care excellencie, that it alwaies worketh and can not be idle. And if with the quicknes of conceyt it be tempred by a modest moderation, to haue regard vnto vertue, and moralitie, then proueth it both goodly &amp; godly: wheras if it run on hedlong, only led by natural considerations of causes, it may proue admirable for some passing quallitie, but it seldome is séene commendable or allowed for perfection. The consideration wherof hath often moued me rather to enstruct youth by a prescribed order out of gods own word, then to nuzzle them ouer déepely in philosophicall opinions. And yet is the mind of young men so prone and prompt to vanitie &amp; delight, that all proueth not as I would haue it. For example behold my late schollers, who forgetting their duetie and neclecting my precepts, are fallen into the snares which I least of al mistrusted: But surely to confesse a trueth, I iudge that it rather procéeded by the entisements of others, then by their own default. Oh how perillous is lewde company vnto youngmen? Well, I haue deuised yet a meane wherby both the Parasites here may bee punished, and the youngmen may also be rebuked at 'Doway: In such sort, that their sodain seperation may preuent all meanes to escape it, and yet that one being ignorant of that others punishment, shall neuer grudge or snuffe at the same. And Phylopaes with his neighbour <pb xml:id="ep000029-043-a"/>Phylocalus promised me eare while to put my deuise in execution, I long to heare what may be done therin, for still I feare me least the crafty Parasite should get knowledge thereof, and so both escape himself and further enfect some other with newe deuises.

          <p>O God how a man may bee deceiued (at the first) in a youngman? the capacitie of this Phylosarcus and hys yokefellow Phylautus was so quick and so sufficient to receiue any charge, that a man would haue beléeued them to haue béene two of the best and towardest youngmen in thys citie, and yet behold how concupicence and vayne delight hath caried them to run another race. I haue receyued letters here from my frind Master in Doway, who deelareth vnto me thereby, that they are sufficyently able to conceiue any tradicion or Science, but therwithall that they are so geuen ouer to pleasures &amp; light pastimes that it is in maner vnpossible to bridle their wandring desires. On that other side he prayseth the other two for the sobrest yong men that euer came vnder his charge, &amp; <pb xml:id="ep000029-049-a"/>confirmeth in effect asmuch as they had written for newes vnto their parentes, whereof I haue greately to reioyce, that (hauing passed through my handes) they are so lykely to come vnto promotion. And as I reioyce in them, so am I most hartely sory for the two elder, that their misgouernment may become not onely a great grief to their parents, but also a hinderance to such commendation as I might else haue gayned by the others: but thus wée may sée, that in euery comfort there may growe some quiet, and no herbe so cleane but may be hindred by stinking wéeds that grow by it. Well I will go talke with their parentes, and if they wilbe ruled by my councell, they shall giue them leaue a little to see the world, and to followe any exercise that be not repugnant vnto vertue, for vnto some wittes neyther correction, nor frendly admonition, nor any other perswasion will serue, vntil their owne rodde haue beaten them, and then they proue oftentymes (though late) men of excellent qualities.
