        <lg>
          <l>TO you most hopefull Prince, not as you are </l>
          <l>But as you may be, do I giue these lines: </l>
          <l>That when your iudgment shal ariue so far, </l>
          <l>As t'ouerlooke th'intricate designes, </l>
          <l>Of vncontented man: you may behold </l>
          <l>With what incounters greatest fortunes cloze, </l>
          <l>What dangers, what attempts, what manifold </l>
          <l>Incumbrances, ambition vndergoes: </l>
          <l>How hardly men digest felicity; </l>
          <l>How to th'intemperat, to the prodigall, </l>
          <l>To wantonesse, and vnto luxury </l>
          <l>Many things want, but to ambition all. </l>
          <l>And you shall find the greatest enemy </l>
          <l>That man can haue, is his prosperity. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Here shall you see how men disguise their ends, </l>
          <l>And playte bad courses vnder pleasing shews, </l>
          <l>How well presumption broken wayes defends, </l>
          <l>Which cleere-eyed iudgment gr√°uely doth disclose. </l>
          <l>Here shall you see how th'easie multitude </l>
          <l>Transported, take the party of distresse; </l>
          <l>And onely out of passion do conclude, </l>
          <l>Not out of iudgment; of mens practises. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <pb xml:id="ep000359-068-a"/>
          <l>How powres are thought to wrong, that wrongs debar, </l>
          <l>And kings not held in danger, though they are. </l>
          <l>These ancient representments of times past; </l>
          <l>Tell vs that men haue, doo, and alwayes runne </l>
          <l>The selfe same line of action, and do cast </l>
          <l>Their course alike, and nothing can be donne, </l>
          <l>(Whilst they, their ends, and nature are the same: </l>
          <l>But will be wrought vpon the selfe-same frame. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>This benefit, most noble Prince, doth yeeld </l>
          <l>The sure recordes of Bookes, in which we finde </l>
          <l>The tenure of our state, how it was held </l>
          <l>By all our ancestors, and in what kinde </l>
          <l>We hold the same, and likewise how in the end </l>
          <l>This fraile possession of felicitie, </l>
          <l>Shall to our late posteritie discend, </l>
          <l>By the same pattent of like destinie. </l>
          <l>In them we finde that nothing can accrew </l>
          <l>To man, and his condition that is new. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And though you haue a Swannet of your owne, </l>
          <l>Which on the bankes of Douen meditates </l>
          <l>Sweete notes for you, and vnto your renowne </l>
          <l>The glory of his Musique dedicates; </l>
          <l>And in a loftie tune is set to sound </l>
          <l>The deepe reportes of Sullein tragedies. </l>
          <l>Yet may this last of me be likewise found, </l>
          <l>Amongst the vowes that others sacrifize </l>
          <l>Vnto the hope of you, that you one day, </l>
          <l>May grace this now neglected harmonie: </l>
          <l>Which set vnto your glorious actions may </l>
          <l>Record the same to all posteritie. </l>

          <l>Though I the remnant of another time. </l>
          <l>Am neuer like to see that happinesse: </l>
          <l>Yet for the zeale that I haue borne to rime, </l>
          <l>And to the Muses wish that good successe </l>
          <l>To others trauaile, that in better place, </l>
          <l>And better comfort, they may be incheerd </l>
          <l>Who shall deserue, and who shall haue the grace </l>
          <l>To haue a Muse held worthy to be heard. </l>
          <l>And know, sweete Prince, when you shall come to know, </l>
          <l>That tis not in the powre of Kings to raise </l>
          <l>A spirit for verse that is not borne thereto: </l>
          <l>Nor are they borne in euery Princes dayes. </l>
          <l>For late Elizas raigne, gaue birth to more </l>
          <l>Then all the kings of England did before. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And it may be, the Genius of that time, </l>
          <l>Would leaue to her the glorie in that kind; </l>
          <l>And that the vtmost powers of English Ryme, </l>
          <l>Should be within her peacefull raigne confinde. </l>
          <l>For since that time, our songues could neuer thriue, </l>
          <l>But laine as if for: though in the prime </l>
          <l>Of this new rising season, we did striue </l>
          <l>To bring the best we could vnto the time. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And I although among the latter traine, </l>
          <l>And least of those that sung vnto this land, </l>
          <l>Haue borne my part, though in an humble straine, </l>
          <l>And pleasd the gentler that did vnderstand: </l>
          <l>And neuer had my harmlesse Pen at all </l>
          <l>Distaind with any loose immodestie, </l>
          <l>Nor euer noted to be toucht with gall, </l>
          <l>To aggrauate the worst mans infamy. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000359-069-a"/>
          <l>But still haue donne the fairest offices </l>
          <l>To virtue and the time, yet nought preuailes, </l>
          <l>And all our labors are without successe, </l>
          <l>For either fauour or our virtue failes. </l>
          <l>And therefore since I haue out liud the date </l>
          <l>Of former grace, acceptance, and delight, </l>
          <l>I would my lines late-borne beyond the fate </l>
          <l>Of her spent line, had neuer come to light. </l>
          <l>So had I not bene tax'd for wishing well </l>
          <l>Nor now mistaken by the censuring stage </l>
          <l>Nor, in my fame and reputation fell. </l>
          <l>Which I esteeme more then what all the age </l>
          <l>Or th'earth can giue. But yeares hath don this wrong, </l>
          <l>To make me write too much, and liue too long. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And yet I grieue for that vnfinisht frame, </l>
          <l>Which thou deare Muse didst vow to sacrifize, </l>
          <l>Vnto the Bed of peace, and in the same, </l>
          <l>Designe our happinesse to memorize, </l>
          <l>Must, as it is remaine, though as it is: </l>
          <l>It shall to after times relate my zeale </l>
          <l>To kings, and vnto right, to quietnesse, </l>
          <l>And to the vnion of the common-weale. </l>
          <l>But this may now, seeme a superfluous vow, </l>
          <l>We haue this peace; and thou hast sung ynow </l>
          <l>And more then wilbe heard, and then as good </l>
          <l>As not to write, as not be vnderstood. </l>
