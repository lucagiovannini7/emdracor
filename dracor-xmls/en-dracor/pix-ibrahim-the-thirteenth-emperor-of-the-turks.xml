          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THat sweetness of temper I have had the Happiness to discover in the honour of your Company in the first place, and your favourable Opinion of my Play in the next, gives me Incouragement to claim your Protection. </p>
        <p>I am often told, and always pleased when I hear it, that the Works not mine; but oh I fear your Closet view will too soon find out the Woman, the imperfect Woman there. The story was true, and the action gave it Life; for I shou'd be very rude not to own each maintain'd their Character beyond my hopes. Then that pretty Ornament, the ingenious Dialogue, these might divert you at the Theatre, but these avail not me; the reading may prove tiresome as a dull repeated tale: Yet I have still recourse to what I mention'd first, your good nature, that I hope <pb xml:id="ep000674-003-a"/>will pardon and accept it. I only wish my self Mistress of Eloquence, Rhetorick, all the Perfections of the Pen, that I might worthily entertain Mr. Minchall. </p>
        <p>Your Noble Family has been long the Glory of my Native Country, and you are what I think no other Nation equals, a true English Gentleman, kind to the distressed, a Friend to all. I dare not proceedâ€” my Weakness wou'd too plainly appear in aiming at a Character which I can never reach: Therefore, I conclude, once more asking your Pardon, and leave to subscribe my self, </p>
        <closer>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
          <signed>Your most humble and Obliged Servant, Mary Pix. </signed>

        <head>THE PREFACE. </head>
        <p>I Did not intend to have troubl'd the Reader with any thing of a Preface; for I am very sensible those that will be so unkind to Criticize upon what falls from a Womans Pen, may soon find more faults than I am ever able to answer. But there happens so gross a mistake, in calling it Ibrahim, the Thirteenth &amp;c. that I cannot help taking notice of it. I read some years ago, at a Relations House in the Country, Sir Paul Ricaut's Continuation of the Turkish History; I was pleas'd with the story and ventur'd to write upon it, but trusted too far to my Memory; for I never saw the Book afterwards till the Play was Printed, and then I found Ibrahim was the Twelfth Emperour. I beg Pardon for the mistake, and hope the Good-Natur'd World will excuse that and what else is amiss, in a thing only design'd for their Diversion. </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE Spoken by Mrs. Cross. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>I'M hither sent, but Heaven knows what to say, </l>
          <l>Or how t' excuse a dull Heroick Play; </l>
          <l>Here's nor poignant Repartee, nor taking Raillery, </l>
          <l>No Feast for Critick Pit, or Graduate Gallery. </l>
          <l>No Beau, who in his very affected Dress, </l>
          <l>Does all the Nonsense of his Character express; </l>
          <l>This Play on solid History depends, </l>
          <l>Old fashion'd stuff, true Love, and faithful Friends. </l>
          <l>The Pit our Author dreads as too severe, </l>
          <l>The ablest Writers scarce find Mercy there; </l>
          <l>Her only hopes in yonder brightness lies, </l>
          <l>If we read praise in those Commanding Eyes: </l>
          <l>What rude Blustering Critique then will dare </l>
          <l>To find a fault, or contradict the Fair? </l>
          <l>Th' humble Offering at your Feet she lays, </l>
          <l>Nor wishes she to live without your Praise: </l>
          <l>Strict Rules of Honour still she kept in view, </l>
          <l>And always when she wrote, she thought on you. </l>
          <l>Then Ladies own it, let not Detracters say, </l>
          <l>You'll not protect one harmless, modest Play. </l>
          <l>The Hero to our Sex is still inclin'd, </l>
          <l>Securing you, we're sure of all Mankind. </l>
          <l>If in that charming Circle you will oft appear, </l>
          <l>An Empty House we sha'n't have cause to fear. </l>
