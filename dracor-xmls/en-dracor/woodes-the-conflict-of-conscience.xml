        <lg>
          <l>WHen whirling windes which blowe with blust'ring blast, </l>
          <l>Shall cease their course, and not the Ayre mooue. </l>
          <l>But still vnstirred it doth stand, it chaunceth at the last, </l>
          <l>To be infect, the trueth hereof euen day by day we prooue, </l>
          <l>For deepe within the Caues of earth, of force it doth behoue, </l>
          <l>Sith that no windes do come thereto, the Ayre out to beate, </l>
          <l>By standing stil the closed ayre, doth breede infections great. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ The streame or flood, which runneth vp and downe, </l>
          <l>Is far more sweete, then is the standing brooke. </l>
          <l>If long vnworne, you leaue a Cloake or Gowne, </l>
          <l>Moathes will it marre, vnlesse you thereto looke: </l>
          <l>Againe, if that vppon a shelfe, you place, or set a booke, </l>
          <l>And suffer it there still to stand, the wormes will soone it eate: </l>
          <l>A Knife likewise, in sheath layde vp, the rust will marre and freat. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ The good road horsse, if still at racke he stand, </l>
          <l>To resty Iade will soone transformed be, </l>
          <l>If long vntild, you leaue a fertile lande, </l>
          <l>From strecke, and weede, no place wilbe left free: </l>
          <l>By these examples, and such like, approoue then well may wee, </l>
          <l>That idlenes more euills doth bring, into the minde of man, </l>
          <l>Then labour great in longer tyme, againe expell out can. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ Which thing our Author marking well, when weried was his minde, </l>
          <l>From reading graue and auncient workes, yet loth his time to loose, </l>
          <l>Bethought himselfe, to ease his heart, some recreance to fynde </l>
          <l>And as he mused in his minde, immediately arose, </l>
          <l>A straunge example done of late, which might as he suppose, </l>
          <l>Stirre vp their mindes to godlines, which shoulde it see or heare, </l>
          <l>And therefore humbly doth you pray, to geue attentiue care. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ The argument or ground wheron our Author chefely stayed, </l>
          <l>Is (sure) a Hystory straunge and true, to many men well knowne, </l>
          <l>Of one through loue of worldly wealth, and feare of death dismaide, </l>
          <l>Because he would his lyfe and goods, haue kept still as his owne, </l>
          <l>From state of grace wherein he stoode, was almost ouerthrowne: </l>
          <l>So that he had no power at all, in heart firme fayth to haue, </l>
          <l>Tyll at the last, God chaungd his mynde his mercies for to craue. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <pb xml:id="ep000799-003-a"/>
          <l>¶ And here, our Author, thought it meete, the true name to omit, </l>
          <l>And at this time, imagine him PHILOLOGVS to be, </l>
          <l>First, for because, a Comedie, will hardly him permit, </l>
          <l>The vices of one priuate man, to touch particulerly, </l>
          <l>Againe, nowe shall it stirre them more, who shall it heare or see, </l>
          <l>For if this worldling had ben namde, we wold straight deeme in minde, </l>
          <l>That all by him then spoken were, our selues we would not finde. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ But syth PHILOLOGVS is nought else, but one that loues to talke, </l>
          <l>And common of the worde of God, but hath no further care, </l>
          <l>According as it teacheth them, in Gods feare for to walke, </l>
          <l>If that we practise this in deede, PHILOLOGI we are, </l>
          <l>And so by his deserued fault, we may in time beware, </l>
          <l>Nowe, if as Author first it meant, you heare it with this gayne, </l>
          <l>In good behalfe he will esteeme, that he bestowed his payne. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ And for because we see by proofe, that men do soone forget, </l>
          <l>Those thinges for which to call them by, no name at all they knowe, </l>
          <l>Our Author for to helpe short wittes, did thinke it very meete, </l>
          <l>Some name for this his Comedy, in preface for to showe, </l>
          <l>Nowe names to natures must agree, as euery man do knowe, </l>
          <l>A fitter name he could in mynde, no where excogitate, </l>
          <l>Then, THE CONFLICT OF CONSCIENCE, the same to nominate. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>A cruell Conflict certainly, where Conscience takes the foyle, </l>
          <l>And is constrained by the flesh, to yelde to deadly sinne, </l>
          <l>Whereby the grace and loue of God, from him, his sinne doeth spoyle, </l>
          <l>Then (wretch accurst) small power hath, repentance to beginne, </l>
          <l>This Hystorie here, example showes, of one fast wrapt therein, </l>
          <l>As in discourse before your eyes, shall plainely prooued be, </l>
          <l>Yet (at the last) God him restoarde, euen of his mercie free. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ And though the Historie of it selfe, be too too, dolorus, </l>
          <l>And would constraine a man with teares of blood, his cheekes to wett, </l>
          <l>Yet to refresh the myndes of them that be the Auditors, </l>
          <l>Our Author intermixed hath, in places fitt and meete, </l>

                <l>Do take delight to liue therein, yea nature doth indue, </l>
                <l>Ech lyuing creature with a feare, least death should them accrue. </l>
                <l>Yea the same Paul at Antioche, dissembled to be dead, </l>

                <l>Elias for to saue his lyfe, to Horeb likwise fled, </l>
                <l>So did king Dauid flee, when Saul did séeke him to annoy: </l>
                <l>Yea Christ himselfe, whom in our deedes, to follow we may ioy, </l>
                <l>Did secreatly conuaigh himselfe, from Iewes so full of hate. </l>

                <l>By godly councell he was woon, all prayse be to the Lorde, </l>
                <l>His errours all, he did renounce, his blasphemies he abhorde: </l>
                <l>And being conuerted, left his lyfe, exhorting foe and friend, </l>
                <l>That do professe the fayth of Christ, to be constant to the ende, </l>
                <l>Full thyrtie wéekes, in wofull wise, afflicted he had bene, </l>
                <l>All which long time, he tooke no foode, but forst against his will, </l>
                <l>Euen with a spoone to poure some broath, his téeth betwéene, </l>
                <l>And though they sought by force, this wise to féede him still, </l>
