        <l>SInce Heroes Ghosts, and Gods have felt your spight: </l>
        <l>Your She Familiars, and your dear delight; </l>
        <l>The Devils shall try their power, w'ee to night: </l>
        <l>Some do believe that Devils ne'r have been, </l>
        <l>Because they think, none can be worse then them: </l>
        <l>But Female Sprights by all are felt and seen. </l>
        <l>You see our Study is to please you all: </l>
        <l>Lets not by stiff Tom Thimbles faction fall; </l>
        <l>Whose censures are meer ign'rance in disguise, </l>
        <l>The noyse of envious fools, that would seem wise. </l>
        <l>If Bacons Brazen-head cry— that won't pass, </l>
        <l>Strayt all the little Fops are turn'd to brass, </l>
        <l>And Eccho to the braying of that Ass: </l>
        <l>Although we take their shapes and sensless sounds, </l>
        <l>Lets not be worryd by our own dull Hounds: </l>
        <l>Let not their noyse that got your Money there, </l>
        <l>Deprave your Iudgments, and your pleasure here. </l>
        <l>Ye men of Sense and Wit, resume your Raign. </l>
        <l>Th'are honour'd who by noble Foes are slain; </l>
        <l>Such comforts wounded Lovers have who swear, </l>
        <l>When their tormenting pains are most severe, </l>
        <l>Dam'ee! </l>
        <l>It does not vex me to be Clapp'd by her: </l>
        <l>Gad she was handsome, though the sport is dear. </l>
        <l>But who in your sight at their mercy lyes, </l>
        <l>Much like an Eastern Malefactor dyes, </l>
        <l>Expos'd i'th' Sun to be devour'd by flyes. </l>
        <l>Let Language, Wit and Plot, this Night be safe, </l>
        <l>For all our business is to make you laugh. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE by Miranda. </head>
        <l>GEntlemen look'ee now, pray, my Father sayes that I and my Sister </l>
        <l>must have ye all i fads: </l>
        <l>Whereof I can't tell what to do, I'le swear'o; </l>
        <l>If I take you, I lose my dear Quakero: </l>
        <l>His things are precious, and his love is true; </l>
        <l>But there's no trust in ought you say or do: </l>
        <l>Yet for ought that I know, </l>
        <l>My self could serve you all as well as any; </l>
        <l>But my Father says, pray, </l>
        <l>One Dish of meat can never serve so many; </l>
        <l>For though you all agree in one design, </l>
        <l>To feed like Schollers on the tender Loyn; </l>
        <l>In this you differ with them, pray; </l>
        <l>One little Chop, and one plain Dish will do. </l>
        <l>You must have Sause, warm Plates, fresh hau-gou's too; </l>
        <l>The large Pottage of glitt'ring show and dress, </l>
        <l>Must cheat you to the little bit of flesh. </l>
        <l>My Father says, </l>
        <l>Since with such charge we purchase your Contents, </l>
        <l>He thinks 'tis fit we should have Settlements: </l>
        <l>For when you have enjoyd, what that is, I cant tell i ●ads; but I beleive you can,— </l>
        <l>Tare dronish, cold and dull as any thing; </l>
        <l>Iust like a Bee, when he has lost his sting: </l>
        <l>And though with all our tempting sweets we strive, </l>
        <l>We ne'r shall catch you more within our Hive. </l>
        <l>Then must our sinking joyes ne'r rise again? </l>
        <l>Must we be kind, and show all in vain? </l>
        <l>You lov'd the jilting Mother much and long; </l>
        <l>She's old, the Daughter's active brisk and young: </l>
        <l>If you neglect us still, pray, </l>
        <l>May all your stony Pride unpit i'd fall; </l>
        <l>And may our harmless Devils take you all. </l>
